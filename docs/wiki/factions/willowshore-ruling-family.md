## Description

For generations, Willowshore was a forgotten place—too small and poor to warrant attention from [Shogun Tsuneni's](../npcs/shogun-tsuneni.md) regime in Jyito. In the absence of oni rule, a local family rose to become the de facto rulers, managing the village's affairs and maintaining order.

Now, with a new oni mayor arriving to claim authority, the family's position is threatened. They have refused to participate in the traditional [Revival of Friendship](../locations/willowshore.md#the-revival-of-friendship)—a ceremony meant to publicly put old grudges to rest and recognize the transfer of power.

## The Family's Shame

The ruling family carries a secret shame connected to [the oldest story about the forest shadows](../locations/willowshore.md#the-forest-story). The tale's ending is never spoken aloud because it embarrasses them:

> The heir to the family fortune was said to have been "lured away by forest spirits." In truth, he simply got drunk and wandered into the woods. The father—a teetotaler—spun the yarn about spirits to save face, and the family has maintained the fiction ever since.

This deception has created factions within Willowshore. Some villagers resent the family's dishonesty; others welcomed the oni's arrival as a chance to unseat the old rulers.

## Current Situation

The family's refusal to perform the Revival of Friendship is an act of quiet defiance—an unofficial protest against the oni's claim to have "always been here." But their position is precarious. They have lost their monopoly on power, and their old secrets may yet come to light.

With [Magistrate Kurosawa's](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) arrival, the family has been displaced from their estate entirely. They are now staying at **Silver Mist Lodge**, a faded inn on the riverside, while the magistrate occupies their former home. This public humiliation has only deepened their resentment.

The magistrate considered them the prime suspects for the warehouse fire that destroyed festival preparations. This suspicion proved correct: [Migo](../npcs/migo.md), the family matriarch, admitted that "more brash" family members hired [Hong](../npcs/hong.md) to destroy the fireworks as a sabotage against the festival. She promised the party that all further planned disruptions would be canceled.

The family is also **actively surveilling** [Magistrate Kurosawa](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md), having tracked his repeated visits to the [Mourndusk Willow](../locations/dark-woods.md) in the Dark Woods. The glen where the tree stands is connected to a tragedy in the family's past.
