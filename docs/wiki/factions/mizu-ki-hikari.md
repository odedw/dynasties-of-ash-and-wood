## Description

Mizu Ki Hikari is the human resistance movement fighting against oni rule in Chu Ye. The name comes from oni naming traditions—a deliberate choice to remind people to stand united against the true threat, regardless of their ancestry or political background.

The organization originally used the name *Tethoke*, which had ties to nationalist movements that advocated independence from the old Lung Wa empire. The new name was adopted to broaden their appeal beyond those old divisions.

## Strategy

The resistance operates from hidden fortresses along the edge of Chuyokai Forest—a place so dark and terrible that even the oni avoid its depths. Their current strategy focuses on three elements:

1. **Stage high-profile robberies** — Make the oni look weak
2. **Redistribute stolen wealth** — Improve humanoid lives
3. **Look impressive while doing it** — Build popular support

Operatives wear immaculate white robes with red trim and veiled conical hats to protect their identity. They speak rarely and time their appearances carefully to avoid authority figures.

## Leadership

The resistance maintains hidden fortresses led by five generals who constantly move to avoid assassination:

| General | Role | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Kalo Komod** | Tactician | Cautious; his strategies keep the organization alive |
| **Duen Fuyan** | Militant | Youngest; advocates scorched earth policy |
| **Den Taijian** | Diplomat | Mediates disputes; brokers foreign alliances |
| **Lee Mingchuen** | Spymaster | Kitsune; operates from the shadows |
| **Giwas Walis** | Quartermaster | Manages supplies and logistics |

## Allies

- **Tengu from Kwanlai** — Smuggling medical supplies by sea
- **Immigrant Wayangs** — Empathize with the oppressed
- **Zhulong** — An underworld dragon destabilizing oni power (potential alliance)

## Relevance to Willowshore

The resistance's influence may extend even to small, forgotten villages like [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md). Their Robin Hood tactics align with certain party members' goals, and the arrival of a new oni mayor presents both a threat and an opportunity.
