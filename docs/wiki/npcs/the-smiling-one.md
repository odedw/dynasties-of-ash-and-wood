## Description

Someone in Willowshore always smiles, even when the news is bad. When misfortune befalls the oni or their allies, this person's expression brightens. When the new regime stumbles, they seem quietly pleased.

They are a member of the old ruling family—the de facto rulers who have been displaced by the arrival of the oni mayor. Unlike others who hide their resentment, this person wears their satisfaction openly, if subtly.

## The Secret

When they think no one is listening, they whisper: *"I know the real ending."*

This refers to [the oldest story villagers tell about the forest shadows](../locations/willowshore.md#the-forest-story)—a tale whose ending is never spoken aloud because it starts fights and embarrasses the ruling family. The Smiling One claims to know what really happened.

---

## Significance

The Smiling One represents the old guard's quiet resistance to oni rule. They know secrets about Willowshore's past that others have forgotten or choose not to speak. Whether they will share this knowledge—and at what price—remains to be seen.
