## Description

Radiant Willow is a young, beautiful flower leshy who practically radiates enthusiasm. She runs **Dew Drop Petals**, a small salon and spa in [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md) where she offers manicures, pedicures, hair styling, beard braiding, and fashion consulting. She's known for her singing and dancing, and will be performing at the Festival of Returning Spirits.

When she enters a room, she brings energy with her—skipping, singing lullabies, and immediately assessing everyone's beauty potential. She sees the world as a canvas waiting to be adorned.

## Personality

Willow is irrepressibly cheerful, effusive, and persistent. She doesn't take "no" for an answer easily—at least not when it comes to offering her services. She believes passionately that everyone deserves to look beautiful, and she cannot understand why anyone would choose to be "drab."

Despite her bubbly exterior, she's an excellent listener. As she styles hair and files nails, people talk to her—and she hears all the gossip in town. She was coy about sharing what she knows, but hinted that a visit to her shop might loosen her tongue.

## Views on the Oni

Willow is cautiously optimistic about the incoming mayor. She hopes the change might bring prosperity and give Willowshore something to smile about. She admires [Magistrate Kurosawa's](magistrate-kurosawa.md) "gorgeous blue skin" but wishes he would smile more. She's reserving judgment until [Mayor Masru](mayor-masru.md) actually arrives.

## Relationships

### Ginkgo
Willow was delighted to meet a fellow leshy and responded warmly to his flattery. She scheduled him for a full makeover the morning before the festival, clearly excited at the prospect of working with fungal aesthetics.

### The Party
She tried (and mostly failed) to interest the others in her services:
- Da Baishan flatly refused to adorn his tusks
- Boone was noncommittal about beard braiding
- Littlefinger declined hair styling but expressed interest in pedicures

Dew Drop Petals offers:

- Hair styling and braiding
- Manicures and pedicures  
- Beard styling (she desperately wants to braid Boone's)
