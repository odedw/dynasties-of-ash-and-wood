## Description

Migo is the matriarch of the Yeshou family—the de facto ruling family of [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md). She is elderly, possibly ancient, having been alive during the family's founding era. She holds court in a darkened suite at Silver Mist Lodge, curtains drawn, wreathed in tobacco smoke, flanked by two guards who are family retainers rather than blood relatives.

She has a piercing gaze and projects quiet, absolute authority. She drinks and smokes with the unhurried ease of someone who has outlasted most of her problems.

## Personality

Migo is sharp, pragmatic, and honest when it serves her interests. She does not posture or waste words. When confronted with the party's evidence of her family's sabotage, she admitted it immediately—calling it a "foolish endeavor" by "more brash" members—rather than wasting time on denials.

She values honesty in return. Da Baishan's straightforward admission that the party was working under the magistrate's orders, but unwillingly, earned her respect and cooperation.

She is protective of her family's legacy and deeply opposed to the oni takeover, but she understands when a gambit has failed and cuts her losses cleanly.

## Goals

- Preserve the Yeshou family's influence in Willowshore during the transition of power
- Monitor [Magistrate Kurosawa's](magistrate-kurosawa.md) activities, particularly his visits to the Dark Woods
- Prevent further embarrassment to the family after the botched warehouse sabotage
- Understand what Kurosawa wants with the [Mourndusk Willow](../locations/dark-woods.md)

## Relationships

### The Party
Migo was impressed by the party's honesty and directness. She shared intelligence about Kurosawa's movements and honored the 100 gold payment to [Hong](hong.md) as promised. She expressed hope for "further conversations and a deeper understanding" with the group.

### [Magistrate Kurosawa](magistrate-kurosawa.md)
She views him with deep suspicion. Her family has been tracking his movements and discovered his repeated visits to the Mourndusk Willow in the Dark Woods. She warned the party that he is "accomplished in the arcane arts" and "not exactly what he seems."

### [Littlefinger](../pcs/littlefinger.md)
She knows Littlefinger through his family connection. She apologized to him specifically for his injuries in the fire, calling them "scratches" with dry understatement.

### [Hong](hong.md)
She took advantage of Hong's desperation, hiring a child to do dangerous work. She acknowledged this was dishonorable and chose to honor the payment regardless.
