## Description

Cassian Voss was a religious researcher from **Absalom**—a continent far from Tian Xia, making him one of the very few foreigners ever to pass through [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md). He arrived roughly two months before [Magistrate Kurosawa](magistrate-kurosawa.md), stayed for about a week, and then supposedly moved on to continue his research elsewhere.

In death, he appears as a translucent blue-white spirit—shimmering like heat haze off summer stone. Water drips from his face and the tattered sleeves of clothing that is distinctly not from Willowshore. He does not remember his own name.

## Research

Voss specialized in what he called **"old gods"**—elder deities that predated the current known pantheon across all traditions. His theory held that before the gods worshipped today, there existed a group of ancient, primordial entities—similar to how Greek mythology's Titans preceded the Olympians.

He came to Tian Xia specifically because its pantheon was unfamiliar to Absalom's scholars, and he hoped to find histories, oral traditions, or other links to these elder gods among the local religious practices. Very little is known about these entities, and Voss's work represented a rare scholarly effort to catalog them.

His research interests align disturbingly well with the **dark summoning ritual** later discovered at the [Mourndusk Willow](../locations/dark-woods.md)—a ritual that [Migo](migo.md) identified as an invocation of the **"Mother of a Thousand Wings"**, an ancient demon of pestilence.

## Death and Spirit

Voss was killed by a spirit at the river near Willowshore. Only [Da Baishan](../pcs/da-baishan.md) and [Ginkgo](../pcs/ginkgo.md) witnessed the death. Following Ginkgo's beliefs about the natural cycle, they hid the body in the forest rather than following local customs for spirit-death disposal.

Since then, Voss's spirit has appeared to Da Baishan and Ginkgo on multiple occasions:

- During the **graveyard combat** (Session Two), the spirit appeared and **shielded Da Baishan** from the undead cat's attack
- He spoke cryptic words: *"You carry me into earth that is not my own. My ties bind beyond these roots. Something stolen, something broken."*
- He cannot cross to the afterlife until the **mystery of his death is solved**

## Personality (In Life)

Based on Donkey's memories, Voss was a quiet, studious man who kept mostly to himself during his brief stay. He was noticeable primarily because foreigners from Absalom are exceedingly rare in this part of the world. He showed no signs of hostility or ill intent—just scholarly curiosity—and his departure seemed unremarkable at the time.

## Open Questions

- **How did he actually die?** — He was killed by a spirit, but what drew the spirit to him? Was his research into old gods the cause?
- **Is his death connected to the ritual?** — His arrival predates the magistrate's, and his research into elder gods overlaps with the summoning of the Mother of a Thousand Wings
- **What was "stolen" and "broken"?** — His spirit's cryptic message suggests something was taken from him and something was violated or destroyed
- **Did someone else benefit from his death?** — Could the ritual have required a sacrifice, and was Voss that sacrifice?
