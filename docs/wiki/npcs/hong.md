## Description

Hong is [Yong's](yong.md) young son—a kitsune boy of about ten years old, energetic and impulsive. He has a restless spirit and dreams of leaving Willowshore for open skies and wide seas, far from the dense forests and small-town life he's known.

Despite his youth, Hong is perceptive enough to recognize opportunity and desperate enough to take dangerous risks for his family's sake.

---

## Personality

Hong is earnest, loyal to his father, and terrible at lying. When confronted by the party at Silver Mist Lodge, his attempts at deception were transparent—darting eyes, stammered excuses, and a visible urge to flee. Once he felt safe enough to talk, his words tumbled out with the unfiltered honesty of a child who knows he's in over his head.

He is not malicious. The warehouse fire was meant to be a "prank"—he genuinely did not intend for anyone to get hurt. He invited Kimmy along to "see the fireworks," not realizing the danger.

## The Warehouse Job

Hong was hired by the [Yeshou family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) to destroy the fireworks stored for the Festival of Returning Spirits. The details:

- **Payment:** 100 gold pieces
- **Instructions:** Cause a "prank" that would disrupt the festival by destroying the fireworks
- **Method:** Hong used kerosene to ensure all the boxes of fireworks would ignite at once, since lighting them individually seemed impractical
- **The girl:** Kimmy was not part of the plan; Hong invited her along
- **The fire:** Got out of control far beyond what Hong expected; the party rescued both children

Hong met with the Yeshou family alone. He does not know if they hired anyone else for similar jobs.

## Family

### [Yong](yong.md) (Father)
Hong idolizes his father and took the dangerous job specifically to help him. Yong has been talking about leaving Willowshore—he "sees dark skies ahead"—but lacks the funds to relocate and re-establish his forge elsewhere. The 100 gold would make that possible.

## Relationships

### The Party
Hong is grateful to the party for rescuing him from the fire and for securing his payment from the Yeshou family. He trusts them, particularly Boone, with whom he had an extended conversation about life beyond Willowshore—open seas, wide skies, places far from forests.

### Boone
While the rest of the party met with [Migo](migo.md), Hong stayed behind with Boone at Silver Mist Lodge. He was fascinated by the dwarf's stories of distant lands and showed little interest in mountains or forests, preferring tales of open coastlines and wide horizons.
