## Description

Shogun Tsuneni is a void oni of immense power—the undisputed ruler of Chu Ye. He overthrew the old order when Imperial Lung Wa fell and has maintained his grip on the nation for a century. His rule is absolute; no challenger has ever come close to threatening his position.

He convenes a ruling council in Jyito once a year to discuss affairs of state—a lavish event designed to appeal to the hedonistic nature of oni, making attendance something officials desire rather than dread.

## Government

Tsuneni rules through two lieutenants who manage day-to-day governance:

- **Steward Imora** (Storm Oni, Marshal) — Oversees the military
- **Steward Tanyo** (Void Oni, Councilor) — Manages the bureaucracy

The ruling council contains several factions that Tsuneni enjoys pitting against each other:

| Faction | Leader | Philosophy |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Daiyoku** | Uno (Caldera Oni) | Militaristic; seeks to conquer all Tian Xia |
| **Shinkaze** | Shiga (Storm Oni) | Isolationist; seeks spiritual redemption |
| **Hedonists** | Tamami (Village Oni) | Pleasure-seekers; no interest in ruling |

## Relevance to Willowshore

Willowshore has been without an oni mayor for generations—a small, forgotten village allowed to govern itself. Now, a new oni mayor is arriving, bringing Tsuneni's regime directly into the lives of the villagers for the first time in living memory.

The arrival has stirred unrest. The old ruling family refuses to participate in the traditional [Revival of Friendship](../locations/willowshore.md#the-revival-of-friendship) ceremony. Tensions are rising.
