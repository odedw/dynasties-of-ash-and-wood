!!! warning "Not Yet Appeared"
    Mayor Masru has not yet arrived in Willowshore. This entry contains only what is known or rumored about him.

## Background

For generations, [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md) was too small and poor to warrant attention from the oni regime. The village governed itself under the [de facto rule of a local family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md). Now, seemingly out of nowhere, an oni mayor has been appointed to take control.

According to oni custom, Mayor Masru will arrive claiming to have "always been here"—the pretense that oni authority is eternal and uninterrupted, even when they've been absent for decades.

---

## Arrival

Masru is expected to arrive the evening of the Festival of Returning Spirits. [Magistrate Kurosawa](magistrate-kurosawa.md) has been sent ahead to prepare the town and ensure the transfer of power proceeds smoothly.

The [Willowshore Ruling Family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) is refusing to participate in the traditional **Revival of Friendship** ceremony—the customary rite where old grudges are publicly put to rest to welcome new leadership. This defiance has created tension throughout the village.

## Significance

Masru's arrival represents the first direct oni rule over Willowshore in living memory. Some villagers see this as an opportunity—the oni are the ruling class, and currying favor could raise their station. Others view it as an invasion, a theft of their autonomy by a regime that ignored them for generations.

The timing of the warehouse fire—destroying festival preparations the day before Masru's arrival—has raised suspicions of sabotage.
