## Description

Magistrate Kurosawa is a 7-foot-tall oni with striking blue skin and a fierce, commanding presence. He wears samurai-style lamellar armor and carries an enormous **nodachi**—a massive two-handed katana that most humans couldn't even lift. His very presence seems to command attention; he rarely needs to raise his voice.

He arrived in [Willowshore](../locations/willowshore.md) a few days before [Mayor Masru](mayor-masru.md), taking up residence in the [Yeshou family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) estate after displacing them. His stated purpose is to ensure the transfer of power proceeds smoothly.

## Personality

Kurosawa projects extreme confidence bordering on arrogance—the certainty of someone who knows they hold all the power. Yet he is not simply a brute. He understands the value of diplomacy and soft power, preferring persuasion to force when possible.

He views the party as useful tools: outsiders without entrenched loyalties who can investigate without raising suspicions. He is direct about this arrangement—he does not pretend to be their friend.

## Goals

- Ensure the Festival of Returning Spirits proceeds without incident
- Establish oni authority over Willowshore with minimal resistance
- Identify and neutralize potential sources of dissent
- Prepare for [Mayor Masru's](mayor-masru.md) arrival
- **Unknown purpose at the Mourndusk Willow** — He has been making repeated visits to an ancient tree in the [Dark Woods](../locations/dark-woods.md); his reasons remain a mystery

## Relationships

### The Party
Kurosawa recruited the party as his deputies, paying them 50 gold up front with 50 more promised upon successful completion of their duties. He sees them as expendable assets who can do the groundwork he cannot—moving among the common folk without inspiring the same fear and silence that follows him.

### The Yeshou Family
He views the [Willowshore Ruling Family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) as the most obvious threat to a smooth transition. He displaced them from their estate and suggested the party investigate them first.

### Mayor Masru
Kurosawa serves as the advance guard for the incoming mayor. His role is to prepare Willowshore for the transfer of power.

### Session Three (2026-02-12)
- Not directly encountered, but the party discovered **physical evidence of his ritual** at the Mourndusk Willow:
    - A ceremonial dagger with Toanin (oni infernal language) inscription: *"Let ancient law be sealed in the hand that guides Willowshore"*
    - A clay bowl of moth wings and blood stains—components of a summoning ritual
    - A lichen blight spreading from the ritual site, infecting nearby wildlife
- Da Baishan's Imperial Lore (24) confirmed "the hand that guides" is a reference to the oni magistrate
- [Migo](migo.md) identified the ritual as a **summoning of the Mother of a Thousand Wings**—an ancient pestilence demon—and stated Kurosawa is likely "well versed" in ley line magic and chose Willowshore specifically for its arcane convergence point
