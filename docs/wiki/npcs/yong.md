## Description

Yong is a young kitsune in his late twenties—fit and strong from years of working the forge. He runs **Eternal Blaze Ironworks**, [Willowshore's](../locations/willowshore.md) only blacksmith shop. While not a master weaponsmith, he can craft serviceable weapons, tools, farming implements, bridles, and barding. Armor is beyond his current skill.

When the party met him, Yong was exhausted and frustrated. [Magistrate Kurosawa](magistrate-kurosawa.md) had been piling work orders on him in preparation for the festival, leaving him little time for regular customers.

---

## Personality

Yong is hardworking and practical, but clearly stressed by the demands of the oni regime. He expressed relief when the party indicated they weren't there on behalf of the magistrate. He loves his son Hong deeply and was terrified when he learned the boy was trapped in the burning warehouse.

## Family

### [Hong](hong.md)
Yong's young son, described as rambunctious but not troublesome. Hong was caught in the warehouse fire along with Kimmy. Despite his playful nature, he's learning the trade and helps at the forge when he can. Yong had planned to give him a set of shuriken he'd crafted.

It was later revealed that Hong was hired by the [Yeshou family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) to set the warehouse fire—a "prank" for 100 gold pieces. Yong did not know about this scheme; Hong acted to fund Yong's plan to leave Willowshore.

## Relationships

### The Party
Yong is deeply grateful to the party for saving Hong's life. He offered to refund all the money they'd paid for their weapon orders as thanks—though the party did not take him up on this offer. He owes them a debt that weighs on him.

### Magistrate Kurosawa
Yong clearly resents the workload the magistrate has imposed on him, though he's too cautious to express this openly. He does not want his son to get in trouble with the oni authorities.

---

## Plans to Leave

Yong privately plans to leave Willowshore. He told Hong he "sees dark skies ahead" for the village and wants to relocate somewhere safer to re-establish his forge. The 100 gold Hong brought home could fund this plan, though Yong is cautious about the windfall—he intends to "pray to our elders and spirits" before deciding whether it's a boon or a darker omen.
