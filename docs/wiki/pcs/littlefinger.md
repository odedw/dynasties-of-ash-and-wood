## Description

Littlefinger is a halfling rogue with connections to [Willowshore's ruling family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md)—whether through marriage, blood, or some other tie remains to be seen. When the family fell on hard times and their influence waned, he turned to thievery to survive.

But he's not just any thief. Littlefinger fancies himself a Robin Hood type: stealing from the oni and their collaborators to help the common folk of Willowshore. There's never an autocrat for good, they say—but maybe there can be a thief for good.

---

## Personality

Littlefinger is cunning and opportunistic, with halfling luck on his side. He's drawn to schemes and capers, always looking for the next mark—preferably someone who deserves to lose what they have.

He has a strong sense that the oni are bad for Willowshore, and he's willing to take risks to undermine them however he can.

## Relationships

### [Da Baishan](da-baishan.md)
Da Baishan caught Littlefinger in the act—breaking into something connected to the oni. The evidence was clear, the crime undeniable. But instead of turning him in, Da Baishan recognized a kindred suspicion of the new regime. They formed an alliance, not from trust, but from aligned purpose. Forged in crime.

### [The Ruling Family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md)
Littlefinger has ties to Willowshore's de facto rulers—the family that refuses to participate in the Revival of Friendship for the new oni mayor. The exact nature of this connection (marriage, blood, employment) remains unclear.
