## Description

Donkey is impossibly old. Nobody knows exactly how old—there's definitely some human back in the woodpile somewhere, and people aren't really sure if he's an elf or a human anymore. He's been around Willowshore forever. The name "Donkey" just came about at some point; he didn't correct people, they didn't ask, and it stuck.

Nobody really knows where he lives. He seems to just live off the land, appearing in town every so often to trade herbs and offer help to those who need it. He's something of a village witch—everyone seems to have had at least one conversation with him, though he doesn't talk much.

## Personality

Donkey speaks rarely, but when he does, his words carry weight—though not always in the way the listener expects. He has a habit of telling truths that are technically accurate but carefully framed to lead people exactly where he wants them to go. Whether this is mischief, wisdom, or something else entirely remains unclear.

He observes more than he participates, watching the town's affairs with the patience of someone who has seen cycles repeat many times over.

## Role in Willowshore

Donkey serves as an informal resource for the village:

- **Herbalist** — Brings herbs from the forest to trade
- **Advisor** — Helps those who seek him out, in his own way
- **Living memory** — Knows everyone and their family histories through sheer longevity

## Relationships

### [Ginkgo](ginkgo.md)
Donkey and Ginkgo share a private tradition—a memorial for a war they both fought in. Once a year, they take time away to remember those who fell. The details remain between them.

### [Boone](boone.md)
Boone fought on the opposite side of the same war. Despite this, there's a shared understanding among all three veterans—none of them feel like winners. The war left its mark on everyone.

### [Da Baishan](da-baishan.md)
Donkey has become one of Da Baishan's sources of information in Willowshore. However, their relationship is complicated. Donkey once told Da Baishan something that was technically true but incomplete, leading the investigator into a dangerous situation. Da Baishan emerged, but he's "still slightly miffed" and doesn't fully trust the old wizard—even as he respects his knowledge.

*"You want to play hardball in Willowshore? I just wanted to see if you got what it takes."*
