## Description

Ginkgo is a fungus leshy who serves as a scout, collecting information about the oni presence in Chu Ye. As a leshy, he is connected to other members of his kind through the mycelium network—a vast underground web of fungal communication that spans the forests.

His fungal nature gives him a unique perspective on life and death. To Ginkgo, decay is not corruption but transformation. Death feeds life. Everything is part of one great ecosystem, endlessly cycling.

## Personality

Ginkgo approaches the world through the lens of ecology and natural cycles. He is uncertain about spirits—their existence doesn't quite fit with his worldview—but he cannot deny that something is happening in Willowshore that defies easy explanation.

He is pragmatic about death in ways that others find unsettling. Where villagers see tragedy, Ginkgo sees the continuation of the cycle.

## Beliefs

Ginkgo's philosophy centers on the interconnectedness of all living things:

- **Death is transformation** — Bodies should return to the earth, feeding new life
- **The mycelium connects all** — Through the fungal network, information and nutrients flow between all living things
- **Spirits are uncertain** — He neither fully believes nor disbelieves, but observes

## Relationships

### [Donkey](donkey.md)
Ginkgo and Donkey share a private tradition—a memorial for a battle they both fought in long ago. On this day each year, they take time away from others to remember. The details of this war remain private between them.

### [Boone](boone.md)
Boone fought on the opposite side of the same war that Ginkgo and Donkey commemorate. There are no winners in their shared history—all three consider themselves on the losing side. This creates an unusual bond of mutual understanding among embittered veterans.

### [Da Baishan](da-baishan.md)
By the river one night, Ginkgo and Da Baishan witnessed a spirit kill a person. According to local legend, death by a spirit means the body could return or be controlled unless disposed of through special rites. Ginkgo, following his beliefs about the natural cycle, convinced Da Baishan to help hide the body in the forest instead—allowing it to decompose naturally and return to the earth. This shared secret binds them.

- Character created
- Established as a fungus leshy cleric connected to the mycelium
- Revealed shared war history with Donkey (same side) and Boone (opposing side)
- Witnessed a spirit killing with Da Baishan; hid the body against local custom

### Session One (2026-01-30)
- Helped rescue children from the burning warehouse; used Message cantrip to guide Hong to safety
- Applied Da Baishan's burn salve to the injured boy
- Provided Guidance to allies throughout the rescue
- Cast Heal on Littlefinger after the rescue
- Met [Radiant Willow](../npcs/radiant-willow.md), a fellow leshy; scheduled for a makeover before the festival
- Recruited as a deputy by [Magistrate Kurosawa](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md)

### Session Two (2026-02-05)
- Cast **Guidance** to help allies during Hong's interrogation
- Offered to accompany Hong to the Yeshou family; shuffled to block the view when Littlefinger palmed a coin
- Identified the **Mourndusk Willow** via Nature check (21)—ancient, rare, linked to dark magics but coexisting harmlessly with Willowshore for generations
- Cast **Bless** during the graveyard combat, providing +1 to attack rolls for the party; sustained and expanded it to 25-foot radius
- Attempted **Divine Lance** against the undead cat (missed)
- Saw the **river spirit**—the same body he and Da Baishan hid—reaching out for help
- Religion check identified the first creature as a ghoul (feeds on recently dead flesh)

### Session Three (2026-02-12)
- Tasted the earth upon entering the Dark Woods (Nature 8—failed to gather useful info, but sensed an unnatural presence through his bare feet)
- Examined the **yellow lichen blight** on the Mourndusk Willow (Nature 25): identified it as an arcane blight—a "bruise" or after-effect of an energy blast, not a natural growth
- Communed with the tree and felt it was **"sad and battered"**
- Scraped the lichen and observed spores releasing into the wind; confirmed the blight was surface-level, not deeply infecting the bark
- **Created a healing salve** from his own body—tearing off a piece of his fungal self, mixing it with healer's toolkit ingredients. Applied it to the tree, turning the lichen gray and neutralizing it

- Attempted to grab and cure a squirrel (failed grapple checks)
- Crafted additional salve during combat for the salve bomb
- Spoke a **farewell to the fallen bear**: *"The soil welcomes you. By tomorrow the forest will know your name."*
- Led the effort to **cleanse the entire tree** of blight using the salve
- Visited [Migo](../npcs/migo.md) with Donkey to share findings; learned about the **Mother of a Thousand Wings** and **ley lines** beneath Willowshore
- Enjoyed Migo's rice cakes (again)
