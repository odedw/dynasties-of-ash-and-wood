## Description

Ginkgo is a fungus leshy who serves as a scout, collecting information about the oni presence in Chu Ye. As a leshy, he is connected to other members of his kind through the mycelium network—a vast underground web of fungal communication that spans the forests.

His fungal nature gives him a unique perspective on life and death. To Ginkgo, decay is not corruption but transformation. Death feeds life. Everything is part of one great ecosystem, endlessly cycling.

## Personality

Ginkgo approaches the world through the lens of ecology and natural cycles. He is uncertain about spirits—their existence doesn't quite fit with his worldview—but he cannot deny that something is happening in Willowshore that defies easy explanation.

He is pragmatic about death in ways that others find unsettling. Where villagers see tragedy, Ginkgo sees the continuation of the cycle.

## Beliefs

Ginkgo's philosophy centers on the interconnectedness of all living things:

- **Death is transformation** — Bodies should return to the earth, feeding new life
- **The mycelium connects all** — Through the fungal network, information and nutrients flow between all living things
- **Spirits are uncertain** — He neither fully believes nor disbelieves, but observes

## Relationships

### [Donkey](donkey.md)
Ginkgo and Donkey share a private tradition—a memorial for a battle they both fought in long ago. On this day each year, they take time away from others to remember. The details of this war remain private between them.

### [Boone](boone.md)
Boone fought on the opposite side of the same war that Ginkgo and Donkey commemorate. There are no winners in their shared history—all three consider themselves on the losing side. This creates an unusual bond of mutual understanding among embittered veterans.

### [Da Baishan](da-baishan.md)
By the river one night, Ginkgo and Da Baishan witnessed a spirit kill a person. According to local legend, death by a spirit means the body could return or be controlled unless disposed of through special rites. Ginkgo, following his beliefs about the natural cycle, convinced Da Baishan to help hide the body in the forest instead—allowing it to decompose naturally and return to the earth. This shared secret binds them.
