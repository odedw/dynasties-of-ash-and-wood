## Description

The Dark Woods lie immediately north of [Willowshore](willowshore.md), separated from the town by a clearing that contains the community graveyard and a few shrines. The forest is dense with deep green trees that grow thick and close together, blocking much of the light even during daytime. Within a few hundred yards of the tree line, visibility drops significantly.

The woods get their name from the dangers that emerge after dark. Willowshore residents universally avoid the forest at night, and the few who have ventured in after sunset have returned with stories of strange lights, unsettling sounds, and worse.

Despite this reputation, Willowshore has coexisted with the Dark Woods for many generations without serious incident—until now.

## The Mourndusk Willow

Deep within the Dark Woods, but "not too deep" from Willowshore's northern edge, stands an extraordinary tree: a **Mourndusk Willow**.

### Appearance
- **Black bark** covering the trunk and roots
- **Black leaves** that droop like a weeping willow
- **Deep, extensive roots** that reach far underground and spread broadly
- Unmistakable from the surrounding forest—entirely distinct from the regular willows that give the town its name

### Nature
Mourndusk Willows are exceedingly rare "old earth trees" that cannot be propagated:
- Taking a leaf or cutting produces nothing—they do not reproduce
- They simply exist, remnants of ancient eons
- Linked in folklore to dark magic, the occult, and cursed places
- Said to be capable of poisoning the surrounding area and its animals
- Despite this, Willowshore has existed near this one without apparent harm for generations

### Connections
- [Magistrate Kurosawa](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) has been visiting the Mourndusk Willow repeatedly since arriving in Willowshore. The [Yeshou family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) has tracked his movements but does not know his purpose.
- The glen where the tree stands is connected to a **tragedy in the Yeshou family's past**—linked to "the song that no one wants to finish."
- Da Baishan's spirit lore found **no connection to the spirit realm**, despite the tree's occult associations.

## The Willowshore Graveyard

At the edge of the Dark Woods, between the town and the tree line, lies Willowshore's community graveyard.

### Features
- **Family plots** arranged in sections throughout the grounds
- **Small shrines** in eastern architectural style (not western-style mausoleums)
- **Cricket cages** — Small cages containing live crickets, placed at intervals throughout the graveyard. Their song is a traditional ward against restless spirits and undead. Standing near a cricket cage provides:
    - +1 to AC against undead
    - +1 on saving throws against fear and spirit effects
- **A grave tender** maintains the grounds—a young woman in her 30s who was terrified when undead rose during Session Two

### The Undead Rising
During Session Two, the party encountered undead emerging from the graveyard for the **first time in living memory**:
- A **ghoul** feeding on a recently exhumed body (someone who died within the past month)
- A **zombie** shambling from between the graves
- An **undead cat** lurking behind a tombstone

The grave tender and Donkey both confirmed this is unprecedented. Something is disrupting the natural cycle of life and death in Willowshore.
