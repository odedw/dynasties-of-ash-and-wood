## Description

The Dark Woods lie immediately north of [Willowshore](willowshore.md), separated from the town by a clearing that contains the community graveyard and a few shrines. The forest is dense with deep green trees that grow thick and close together, blocking much of the light even during daytime. Within a few hundred yards of the tree line, visibility drops significantly.

The woods get their name from the dangers that emerge after dark. Willowshore residents universally avoid the forest at night, and the few who have ventured in after sunset have returned with stories of strange lights, unsettling sounds, and worse.

Despite this reputation, Willowshore has coexisted with the Dark Woods for many generations without serious incident—until now.

## The Mourndusk Willow

Deep within the Dark Woods, but "not too deep" from Willowshore's northern edge, stands an extraordinary tree: a **Mourndusk Willow**.

### Appearance
- **Black bark** covering the trunk and roots
- **Black leaves** that droop like a weeping willow
- **Deep, extensive roots** that reach far underground and spread broadly
- Unmistakable from the surrounding forest—entirely distinct from the regular willows that give the town its name

### Nature
Mourndusk Willows are exceedingly rare "old earth trees" that cannot be propagated:
- Taking a leaf or cutting produces nothing—they do not reproduce
- They simply exist, remnants of ancient eons
- Linked in folklore to dark magic, the occult, and cursed places
- Said to be capable of poisoning the surrounding area and its animals
- Despite this, Willowshore has existed near this one without apparent harm for generations

### Connections
- [Magistrate Kurosawa](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) has been visiting the Mourndusk Willow repeatedly since arriving in Willowshore. The [Yeshou family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) has tracked his movements but does not know his purpose.
- The glen where the tree stands is connected to a **tragedy in the Yeshou family's past**—linked to "the song that no one wants to finish."
- Da Baishan's spirit lore found **no connection to the spirit realm**, despite the tree's occult associations.

## The Willowshore Graveyard

At the edge of the Dark Woods, between the town and the tree line, lies Willowshore's community graveyard.

### Features
- **Family plots** arranged in sections throughout the grounds
- **Small shrines** in eastern architectural style (not western-style mausoleums)
- **Cricket cages** — Small cages containing live crickets, placed at intervals throughout the graveyard. Their song is a traditional ward against restless spirits and undead. Standing near a cricket cage provides:
    - +1 to AC against undead
    - +1 on saving throws against fear and spirit effects
- **A grave tender** maintains the grounds—a young woman in her 30s who was terrified when undead rose during Session Two

### The Undead Rising
During Session Two, the party encountered undead emerging from the graveyard for the **first time in living memory**:
- A **ghoul** feeding on a recently exhumed body (someone who died within the past month)
- A **zombie** shambling from between the graves
- An **undead cat** lurking behind a tombstone

The grave tender and Donkey both confirmed this is unprecedented. Something is disrupting the natural cycle of life and death in Willowshore.

## The Ley Line Convergence

[Migo](../npcs/migo.md) revealed that Willowshore sits at a convergence of **ley lines**—arcane geomancy paths deep in the earth. Just as five rivers join on the surface, these invisible lines of magical energy cross beneath the village, creating a **focal point** that can be tapped to amplify magical power.

The Mourndusk Willow, with its ancient roots reaching deep into the earth, acts as a **"lightning rod"** for rituals that tap into these ley lines. This convergence is likely the true reason [Magistrate Kurosawa](../npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) was assigned to Willowshore—not just to oversee a political transition, but to exploit this magical nexus.

## The Summoning Ritual

During Session Three, the party discovered evidence of a **dark summoning ritual** performed at the base of the Mourndusk Willow:

### Ritual Components Found
- **A ceremonial steel dagger** — Curved blade, ornate leather-wrapped handle, inscribed in **Toanin** (oni infernal language): *"Let ancient law be sealed in the hand that guides Willowshore"*
- **A clay bowl** — Unglazed earthenware containing crushed **moth wings** (bodies removed) and traces of blood
- **A smooth depression** — Between two roots at the tree's base, approximately two feet deep; the earth unnaturally smooth

### The Yellow Lichen Blight
The ritual produced a **lichen blight** as a byproduct—a pale yellow, mossy growth that erupted from the east side of the tree in a blast pattern. Ginkgo (Nature 25) identified it as an arcane "bruise"—an after-effect of the energy released during the ritual, not a natural growth. The blight:
- Was spreading to the tree's bark, roots, and nearby ground
- Infected local wildlife (a bear and squirrels), giving them yellow eyes and aggressive behavior
- Released **sulfurous spores** when disturbed (requiring Fortitude saves)
- Could be **neutralized by Ginkgo's fungal salve**, turning it gray and causing it to flake off
- The party fully cleansed the tree and surrounding area of the blight

### Identification
- Da Baishan (Occultism 24) identified the ritual as a **dark sacrificial substitution**—a communion or summoning that was at least partially successful
- [Migo](../npcs/migo.md) identified the entity being summoned as the **"Mother of a Thousand Wings"**—an ancient demon of pestilence

## Session History

### Session Two (2026-02-05)
- The Dark Woods and Mourndusk Willow described by [Migo](../npcs/migo.md) and identified by Ginkgo
- Kurosawa's secret visits to the Mourndusk Willow revealed
- The graveyard became the site of the party's first combat encounter
- Undead rising identified as an unprecedented event for Willowshore
- The party headed into the Dark Woods at mid-afternoon with ~6 hours of daylight remaining

### Session Three (2026-02-12)
- The party entered the Dark Woods and immediately noticed the forest felt **different**—colder, heavier, with an unnatural presence watching them
- Reached the Mourndusk Willow clearing; discovered the yellow lichen blight and summoning ritual components
- Fought **blight-infected wildlife**: a bear and two squirrels with yellow lichen and glowing yellow eyes
- Ginkgo crafted a **healing salve** from his own body that neutralized the lichen; the party created a **salve bomb** that cured both squirrels
- Da Baishan investigated the ritual objects; Ginkgo communed with the tree (it was "sad and battered")
- The party spent the remaining daylight cleansing the tree and surrounding area of all blight
- [Migo](../npcs/migo.md) later identified the ritual as a summoning of the **Mother of a Thousand Wings** and explained the **ley line convergence** beneath Willowshore
