## Description

Nestled on a slow bend of the rain-swollen Yanzy River, the town of Willowshore is a place of faded glory and stubborn heart. Here at the edge of Chu Ye's wild, mysterious forest, old festivals are honored even as old wounds fester. Strangers' footsteps are watched, and secrets settle thick as mist along the water's edge.

The town sits at a junction of rivers—once a thriving logging and mining hub, now a skeleton of its former self. The closest shore leads north to the sea; the rivers join together into a large lake to the east.

## History

Willowshore had a heyday long ago, but those days are past. The old industries collapsed, and the population dwindled. For generations, the village was too small and poor to warrant attention from [Shogun Tsuneni's](../npcs/shogun-tsuneni.md) regime. In the oni's absence, a [local family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) rose to become de facto rulers.

Now, after generations without an oni mayor, one is finally arriving—claiming to have "always been here." This has stirred unrest and reopened old divisions.

## Traditions

### The Revival of Friendship

A traditional rite observed at every change of power—whether a new store manager or a new mayor—where old grudges are publicly put to rest. It serves as an unofficial but very customary Transfer of Power.

The [ruling family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) is refusing to participate in the ceremony for the new oni mayor. This defiance has created tension throughout the village.

### Festival of Returning Spirits

An ancient festival held on the eve of autumn, meant to protect Willowshore from whatever haunts the dark woods beyond. The whole town gathers as lanterns flicker and drums thrum. Participants are chosen to lead a ceremonial play, walking in the shadows as the founders once did—acting out the fragile bargain that keeps the unknown at bay.

## The Forest Story

The oldest story villagers whisper about the forest shadows involves will-o-wisps that lead people astray into the woods.

**Why no one speaks the ending:**

The story's ending is never told aloud—not because it's forgotten, but because no one can agree on it, and speaking it starts fights. The disagreement runs deep, touching on old loyalties and resentments.

The truth, known to few: The ending embarrasses the [ruling family](../factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md). The heir to the family fortune was said to have been "lured away by forest spirits." In reality, he simply got drunk and wandered into the woods. His father—a teetotaler—spun the tale about spirits to save face.

This deception created factions. Some people secretly blame each other; some welcomed the oni as a chance to unseat the old rulers. One member of the ruling family ([The Smiling One](../npcs/the-smiling-one.md)) whispers when they think no one is listening: *"I know the real ending."*

## Local Customs

- **Averting eyes from oni**: When oni enter town, lower classes must avert their gaze—only the ruling class may look upon them
- **"I've always been here"**: The official stance that oni have always been present, despite obvious evidence otherwise
- **Spirit death rituals**: Local legend holds that death near a spirit requires special disposal of the body, lest it return or be controlled
