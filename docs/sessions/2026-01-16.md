# Session Zero: The Founding

**Date:** January 16, 2026

---

## Overview

Session zero established the campaign premise, created five player characters, built collaborative world lore for [Willowshore](../wiki/locations/willowshore.md), and forged inter-character bonds. The campaign will begin at the Festival of Returning Spirits, with a new oni mayor arriving to claim authority over this forgotten village.

## Campaign Premise

### The Setting

![Willowshore Region](images/willowshore-region.jpg)

*Willowshore sits at the confluence of rivers in northern Chu Ye, surrounded by dense forest.*

Nestled on a slow bend of the rain-swollen Yanzy River, the town of [Willowshore](../wiki/locations/willowshore.md) is a place of faded glory and stubborn heart. Here at the edge of Chu Ye's wild, mysterious forest, old festivals are honored even as old wounds fester. Strangers' footsteps are watched, and secrets settle thick as mist along the water's edge.

### The Tension

For generations, Willowshore has been forgotten—too small and poor to warrant attention from [Shogun Tsuneni's](../wiki/npcs/shogun-tsuneni.md) oni regime. A local family rose to become de facto rulers. Now, after decades without an oni mayor, one is finally arriving—claiming to have "always been here."

The [ruling family](../wiki/factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) refuses to participate in the traditional **Revival of Friendship** ceremony. Old secrets threaten to surface. And on the eve of autumn, our heroes have been chosen to lead the **Festival of Returning Spirits**—walking in the shadows as the founders once did.

*The village features a central manor, torii gate, scattered buildings, farmland, and a graveyard at the forest's edge.*

## World-Building Decisions

The group collaboratively answered "unsteady questions" to shape Willowshore's lore:

### 1. The Tradition for the Oni's Arrival

> **Question:** When the new mayor (the oni) arrives, what tradition must be observed to keep the peace, and who in town refuses to take part?

**Answer:** You cannot look upon the oni as they enter town. The pretense is that they have "always been here." The **Revival of Friendship** is a traditional rite at every change of power where old grudges are publicly put to rest. The ruling family is refusing to attend the festival and perform the unofficial Transfer of Power.

### 2. The Forest Story

> **Question:** What is the oldest story villagers whisper about the forest shadows, and why does nobody ever say the story's ending aloud?

**Answer:** Beware the will-o-wisps in the forest, which lead people astray. The ending is never spoken because no one can agree on it—too many fights start. Secretly, people blame each other.

The truth: The ending embarrasses the ruling family. The heir to the fortune was "lured by spirits from the forest"—but he was actually just drunk. His father (a teetotaler) spun this yarn to save face. This created factions: some welcomed the oni as a chance to unseat the old rulers.

### 3. The Smiling One

> **Question:** Someone in Willowshore always smiles, even when the news is bad. What do they say when they think no one's listening?

**Answer:** A member of the ruling family smiles when the oni stumble. When they think no one is listening, they whisper: *"I know the real ending."*

## Character Bonds

### Ginkgo + Donkey: The Memorial
Ginkgo and Donkey are veterans of the same war. They share a private tradition—a memorial they observe together each year. The details remain between them.

### Boone vs. Ginkgo & Donkey: The Other Side
Boone fought on the opposite side of that same war. Despite this, all three consider themselves losers. The war was like Vietnam—nobody really won, and everyone carries the weight.

### Da Baishan + Littlefinger: Forged in Crime
Da Baishan caught Littlefinger breaking into something connected to the oni. Instead of turning him in, he recognized a shared suspicion of the new regime. An alliance formed—not from trust, but from aligned purpose.

### Da Baishan + Donkey: The Unreliable Source
Donkey is one of Da Baishan's sources for information in Willowshore. But Donkey once told him something "technically true" that led Da Baishan into a dangerous situation. He emerged, but he's still slightly miffed. Trust is... conditional.

### Da Baishan + Ginkgo: The Body by the River
One night by the river, Da Baishan and Ginkgo witnessed a spirit kill someone. Local legend says death by a spirit means the body must be specially disposed of, lest it return. But Ginkgo—following his beliefs about the natural cycle—convinced Da Baishan to hide the body in the forest instead, letting it decompose naturally. This shared secret binds them.

## Open Threads

### Mysteries

- **The real ending** — What truly happened to the ruling family's heir?
- **The oni's return** — Why is an oni mayor coming to Willowshore now, after generations?
- **The body by the river** — Will Ginkgo and Da Baishan's secret come back to haunt them?
- **The Smiling One** — What does the ruling family member know, and will they share it?

### The Festival

The campaign begins at the **Festival of Returning Spirits**. The party has been chosen to lead the ceremonial play—walking in the shadows as the founders once did, acting out the fragile bargain that keeps the unknown at bay.

Something strange stirs on the eve of autumn. The oni mayor's arrival has unsettled the town. And in the flickering lantern light, eyes watch from somewhere beyond...
