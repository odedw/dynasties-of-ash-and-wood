# Session One: Fire and Favors

**Date:** January 30, 2026

---

## Overview

The morning before the new oni mayor's arrival, a suspicious explosion at the warehouse traps two children in a raging fire. The party rescues them, catches the attention of [Magistrate Kurosawa](../wiki/npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md), and finds themselves recruited as his deputies—tasked with ensuring the Festival of Returning Spirits proceeds without incident.

## Key Events

### Shopping at the Blacksmith

The party visited [Yong](../wiki/npcs/yong.md) at **Eternal Blaze Ironworks** to commission weapons:

- Da Baishan ordered a polearm with D-rings for a pennant
- Boone traded his longsword plus 8 gold for a ji-sarm (curved-blade polearm for tripping)
- Littlefinger purchased four shuriken and traded his dagger to Da Baishan for an orcish sap

Yong was exhausted—the magistrate had been piling work orders on him. He agreed to have the weapons ready in a few days.

### The Warehouse Fire

While at the forge, an explosion rocked the docks. A warehouse filled with fireworks for the festival was ablaze, with two children trapped inside:

- **Hong** — [Yong's](../wiki/npcs/yong.md) young son, a kitsune boy
- **Kimmy** — Daughter of the woman who runs **Cloud Paper Lodge**

The party rushed in through smoke and flame:

- **Littlefinger** led the way, taking damage from exploding fireworks and falling shelves while trying to reach Hong. He used Halfling Luck to save the boy, then threw himself over the child to shield him from collapsing crates.
- **Ginkgo** used Message to guide Hong toward them, pulled him free, and applied Da Baishan's burn salve.
- **Boone** dove through fire (his forge dwarf ancestry granting fire resistance), found Kimmy in shock, scooped her up, and smashed through a window to escape.
- **Da Baishan** guarded the exit, prepared medical supplies, and began investigating the scene.

### Da Baishan's Investigation

Da Baishan's forensic examination revealed:

- The fire was **not an accident**—kerosene had been used as an accelerant
- The burn patterns on Hong's hands suggested he was close to the initial explosion
- The speed at which the fire spread was unnaturally fast
- **Working theory:** Someone sabotaged the fireworks to ignite during the festival. The children, sneaking in to look at fireworks, accidentally triggered it early.

The investigation has been formally opened as **"The Investigation of the Children's Fire."**

### Recruited by the Magistrate

[Magistrate Kurosawa](../wiki/npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md), the tall blue-skinned oni who arrived ahead of the mayor, approached the party after the rescue. He assessed their skills and made them an offer they couldn't refuse:

- Serve as his **deputies** to ensure the festival proceeds smoothly
- Investigate dissent and report threats to the transfer of power
- **Payment:** 50 gold pieces up front; 50 more upon successful completion
- **Warning:** Failure would carry a "very high price"

The party accepted, recognizing that refusal wasn't really an option—and that the job would give them cover to investigate on their own terms.

Kurosawa suggested the [Willowshore Ruling Family](../wiki/factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md) as the obvious suspects, as they have the most to lose from the oni's arrival.

### Settling at Silver Mist Lodge

The party crossed the river to **Silver Mist Lodge**, where the displaced ruling family is staying. They:

- Booked a room for five days (5 gold total, under Littlefinger's name)
- Enjoyed a complimentary meal and drinks
- Began planning their investigation

### Meeting Radiant Willow

[Radiant Willow](../wiki/npcs/radiant-willow.md), a flowery leshy who runs **Dew Drop Petals** (a salon and spa), arrived at the lodge. She was effusive, charming, and extremely interested in making everyone beautiful before the festival:

- She scheduled Ginkgo for a makeover the next morning
- She hinted that people share gossip while getting their hair done
- She mentioned she would be performing a dance at the festival

The session ended with the party planning their next moves over fish and drinks at mid-morning.

## Memorable Moments

- **Littlefinger's heroic catch:** After failing to climb the shelves, he spotted the boy through the flames and threw himself over Hong to shield him from falling debris—taking damage but saving the child
- **Boone's dramatic exit:** The forge dwarf dove through fire, scooped up the terrified girl, and crashed through a window to deliver her to her mother's arms
- **Da Baishan's negotiation:** Successfully talked Kurosawa up from "the honor of service" to 100 gold pieces for the job
- **Ginkgo's mystique:** Radiant Willow was enchanted by this fellow leshy, setting up a potential information-gathering opportunity
- **Hong's words:** "It wasn't my fault. I'm sorry." — hinting at guilt or fear about what really happened
