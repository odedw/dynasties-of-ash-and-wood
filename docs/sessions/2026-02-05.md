# Session Two: Skin a Cat

**Date:** February 5, 2026

---

## Overview

The party interrogates young [Hong](../wiki/npcs/hong.md) and learns the warehouse fire was a paid sabotage job commissioned by the [Yeshou family](../wiki/factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md). A tense but productive meeting with the family's matriarch, [Migo](../wiki/npcs/migo.md), yields a promise to cancel further disruptions—and a warning that [Magistrate Kurosawa](../wiki/npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) has been making secretive visits to an ancient [Mourndusk Willow](../wiki/locations/dark-woods.md) in the Dark Woods. On their way north to investigate, the party fights their first combat—a graveyard skirmish against undead that should not exist in Willowshore—and the spirit of a dead man reaches out to Da Baishan and Ginkgo, begging them to solve the mystery of his death.

## Key Events

### Donkey Rejoins the Party

Donkey, recovered from his illness, found the rest of the group at **Silver Mist Lodge** around mid-morning. The party filled him in on the events of the previous day—the fire, the magistrate's recruitment, and their suspicions about the ruling family.

### Hong's Confession

[Hong](../wiki/npcs/hong.md) burst into Silver Mist Lodge carrying an empty satchel, spotted the party, and tried to flee. Donkey called after him with enough authority to stop him in his tracks. Through a combination of diplomacy, intimidation, and Littlefinger's street-smart prodding, the boy confessed:

- He was **hired to blow up the fireworks warehouse** as a "prank" to disrupt the festival
- He used **kerosene** to ensure all the fireworks would ignite at once
- He was promised **100 gold pieces** for the job
- The girl (Kimmy) was not supposed to be there—he invited her to "see the fireworks"
- The person who hired him was described only as having "the most money"—which Donkey and Littlefinger recognized as the [Yeshou family](../wiki/factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md)
- Hong's father [Yong](../wiki/npcs/yong.md) "sees dark skies ahead" for Willowshore and planned to use the gold to relocate the family

Da Baishan's **Clue In** ability and Ginkgo's **Guidance** spell helped the party read Hong's evasions throughout the interrogation.

### Audience with the Matriarch

The party sent Hong to stay with Boone and ask other children about similar plots, then went upstairs to confront the [Yeshou family](../wiki/factions/willowshore-ruling-family.md).

[Migo](../wiki/npcs/migo.md), the elderly matriarch, received them in a darkened room thick with tobacco smoke. Two bodyguards flanked her. Despite her stern demeanor, she was forthcoming:

- She **admitted the family sponsored the sabotage**, calling it a "foolish endeavor" by "more brash" family members
- She **promised to cancel all other planned disruptions** in exchange for the party's honesty about their own situation
- She **honored the 100 gold payment to Hong**, having a guard fill the satchel
- She revealed that [Magistrate Kurosawa](../wiki/npcs/magistrate-kurosawa.md) has been **visiting the Dark Woods** repeatedly, drawn to an ancient tree called the **[Mourndusk Willow](../wiki/locations/dark-woods.md)**
- She warned that Kurosawa is **"accomplished in the arcane arts"** and not what he seems
- She cautioned the party to **venture into the Dark Woods only during daylight**

Da Baishan was honest about the party's dual role—investigating both for themselves and under the magistrate's orders—which earned Migo's respect.

### Ginkgo's Nature Knowledge

Ginkgo (Nature 21) recognized the Mourndusk Willow as an exceedingly rare "old earth tree":

- Black bark, black leaves, deep roots that extend far underground
- Cannot be propagated—they simply exist from ancient times
- Linked to occult or dark magics in folklore
- Surrounding areas can allegedly become poisoned, though Willowshore has coexisted with it for generations

Da Baishan's spirit lore (15) found no connection to the spirit realm. Donkey's Willowshore Lore (18) revealed the tree's glen is tied to a **tragedy in the Yeshou family's past**—connected to "the song that no one wants to finish."

### Returning the Gold

The party escorted Hong back to the forge with his 100 gold. Littlefinger attempted to palm a coin ("We'll make sure you get your 90 gold pieces, Hong") but couldn't bring himself to actually steal from a child and handed the full satchel over.

[Yong](../wiki/npcs/yong.md) was bewildered by the windfall. He refunded the party's 3 gold deposit for their weapon orders and promised to have the blades ready by dusk. He was cautious about the gold, saying he needed to "pray to our elders and spirits" to determine if it was a boon or a darker omen.

**Donkey examined a palmed coin** (Littlefinger swiped one for inspection purposes). Society check confirmed it was standard local coinage—no foreign markings or irregularities.

### The Graveyard: First Combat

On the way north toward the Dark Woods, the party encountered a **grave tender** fleeing the community graveyard, screaming about the dead rising. They found:

- A **ghoul** hunched over a recently exhumed body, feeding on the corpse
- A **zombie** shambling from behind a tomb
- An **undead cat** that ambushed Littlefinger from behind a gravestone

**Cricket cages** placed throughout the graveyard provided defensive bonuses to those standing near them: +1 to AC against undead and +1 on saving throws against fear and spirit effects.

#### Combat Highlights

- **Donkey** opened with Tangle Vine, immobilizing the ghoul and reducing its speed by 10 feet—then set the second zombie on fire with Ignition
- **Boone** used Sudden Charge to close distance and eventually cleaved both the ghoul (vertically) and the zombie (horizontally) with his longsword
- **Ginkgo** cast **Bless** (15-foot radius, later sustained to 25 feet), granting all allies +1 to attack rolls for most of the fight
- **Littlefinger** scored a nat 20 on initiative but struggled to hit the undead cat with his rapier—until he finished it off with a perfectly thrown shuriken to its hollow eye
- **Da Baishan** used **Devise a Stratagem** for the first time, rolling a 19 and using it to precisely skewer the cat; he also contributed crossbow fire
- **Donkey** learned the hard way that **Daze doesn't work on mindless undead** (DM gave a religion check first as a warning, but nobody rolled high enough)
- Donkey picked up a **cricket cage** for its protective benefits during combat

### The River Spirit Returns

During and after combat, **only Da Baishan and Ginkgo** could see a translucent blue-white spirit hovering nearby. It was the same person whose death they witnessed by the river—the body they buried in the forest.

The spirit:

- Appeared protective, not hostile—it **shielded Da Baishan from the cat's attack** at one point
- Spoke cryptic words: *"You carry me into her that is not my own. My ties bind beyond these roots. Something stolen, something broken."*
- Does not remember its own name or identity
- Wears clothing that **does not match Willowshore locals**—likely a foreigner
- Cannot cross to the afterlife until the **mystery of its death is solved**

### Undead: An Unprecedented Event

The grave tender confirmed this has **never happened before**. Donkey's local knowledge corroborated—Willowshore has coexisted peacefully with the Dark Woods for generations. The appearance of undead is new, and something is disrupting the natural cycle of life and death.

Ginkgo's religion check identified the first creature as a **ghoul** (drawn to recently dead flesh), not a standard zombie—meaning the exhumed body was someone who died within the past month.

## Memorable Moments

- **Littlefinger's interrogation:** "We've all done stuff for girls, Hong. Go ahead. Keep telling us."—channeling his best Law & Order energy to coax the truth from a terrified ten-year-old
- **The gold negotiation:** The running gag of the party "helpfully" reducing Hong's payment—"We'll make sure you get your 90 gold pieces." "Yeah, you'll get your 30 gold pieces, don't worry." "We'll get you 25 gold pieces, no problem."
- **Littlefinger's conscience:** Despite his rogue instincts, he couldn't actually steal from a kid—handing the full satchel over after a comedic tug-of-war
- **Boone's finishing moves:** Cleaving the ghoul top-to-bottom and the zombie left-to-right, establishing a signature style
- **The spirit's shield:** An unseen guardian deflecting the undead cat's claws from Da Baishan—a moment only he and Ginkgo witnessed
- **Donkey's cricket:** Picking up the cricket cage during combat for its AC bonus, then reluctantly returning it to the grave tender afterward
- **Da Baishan's stratagem debut:** The Sherlock Holmes-style analysis of the cat's movement, predicting its dodge and skewering it precisely

## The Scene

![Something Stolen, Something Broken](images/spirit-shield-graveyard.png)

The cat was fast—faster than anything dead had a right to be. It came off the tombstone like a loosed arrow, all hollow eyes and exposed bone, and Da Baishan barely got his short sword up before its claws raked across his guard. The orc cursed in his mother tongue, pivoting on the soft graveyard earth, trying to track the thing as it circled him with the low, sideways prowl of a predator that had forgotten it no longer needed to eat. Behind him, the cricket sang on—a thin, bright thread of sound cutting through the groans and the clash of steel. Somewhere to the north, Boone roared and something wet came apart. Nearby, Donkey's Daze spell washed over the shambling zombie and found nothing to grip—no mind behind those hollow eyes, no thoughts to jolt. The old wizard's face flickered with surprise, then understanding. But here, in this corner of the cemetery between the family plots and the low stone markers, it was just Baishan and the cat and the strange cold feeling that had been crawling up his spine since they'd entered the graveyard.

The cat lunged. Baishan saw the arc of its claws, knew the angle, knew he couldn't get the blade around in time—and then the air between them *thickened*. A shape condensed out of nothing: blue-white, translucent, shimmering like heat haze off summer stone. It was a man. Or the memory of a man. He stood with his back to Baishan, arms spread as if to embrace the blow, and when the cat's claws struck they passed through him with a sound like tearing silk and found nothing beyond. The cat hissed—a rattling, waterlogged sound—and recoiled. Water dripped from the spirit's face, from the tattered sleeves of clothing that was not from Willowshore, and for a heartbeat Baishan was standing by the river again in the dark, watching this same figure die. Ginkgo, ten feet away, had gone completely still. The leshy's fungal eyes were wide, fixed on the apparition. No one else saw it. The spirit turned—slowly, as if moving through deep water—and looked at the orc who had hidden his body in the forest.

Its mouth moved. The words arrived not through the air but somewhere behind the eyes, settling into understanding the way ink bleeds into wet paper: *You carry me into earth that is not my own. My ties bind beyond these roots. Something stolen. Something broken.* The spirit's gaze was not angry. It was tired. It was the look of someone standing at a door they cannot open, holding a key that fits no lock they can find. Then the cat snarled and gathered itself for another pounce, and Baishan blinked, and the spirit was gone—dissolved into the autumn light like breath on a cold morning. From across the graveyard, a shuriken whistled through the air and buried itself in the cat's hollow eye socket with a sound like a nail driven into rotten wood. The creature collapsed. The cricket sang. And Da Baishan stood among the graves, holding a debt he did not yet know how to pay.
