00:00 Chris as Boon:  Small.

00:02 Gary the DM:  Formerly mining, forestry kind of community, you know, at the mouth of several rivers that.

00:07 Gary the DM:  That join. This is a few a day before the arrival of this mayor, this oni mayor who is rumored

00:18 Gary the DM:  to come in. Masru is his name.

00:21 Gary the DM:  That's the only thing you know about him other than he's an oni, which is like a.

00:26 Gary the DM:  Imagine like a a demon devil type type race or ancestry.

00:32 Gary the DM:  He isn't supposed to arrive the next morning when this, the festival is supposed to happen.

00:39 Gary the DM:  The festival that right now is the town is kind of preparing for.

00:44 Gary the DM:  So we are the day before.

00:46 Gary the DM:  It's early morning and there's excitement in town.

00:54 Gary the DM:  The mists that roll off the river formerly thick seems thicker today than maybe even past days.

01:02 Gary the DM:  The roll, they roll low across the riverbanks.

01:08 Gary the DM:  As you guys, as the town is preparing for this festival, there's, you know, tradespeople doing things like creating paper

01:14 Gary the DM:  lanterns and other folks getting together a feast and preparing decorations and stuff.

01:20 Gary the DM:  Others are going about their normal day.

01:22 Gary the DM:  So you know, there's fishermen who are getting, you know, the catch of the day.

01:27 Gary the DM:  There's people who are, you know, tending to gardens and other types of crafts.

01:32 Gary the DM:  You can hear the hammering of the blacksmith who's in town and other types of crafts.

01:37 Gary the DM:  People are doing some work. Some things might be for the festival itself and others just might be, you know,

01:43 Gary the DM:  for their normal job and kind of commission type work.

01:48 Gary the DM:  So for the this. A few days before the mayor arrived, there was a new arrival in town.

01:56 Gary the DM:  He's kind of preparing for the mayor.

01:59 Gary the DM:  He is a magistrate, he's also an owner.

02:02 Gary the DM:  He's been kind of commanding townsfolks and kind of making sure that things go well.

02:09 Gary the DM:  When Mayor Masru joins his. He's Kurosawa and he is a tall, fierce, blue skinned oni who commands attention and

02:24 Gary the DM:  has kind of some of the townsfolks on edge.

02:27 Gary the DM:  They didn't know that he was going to arrive, but he's been in town for a couple days and is

02:32 Gary the DM:  making sure that things go go well.

02:35 Gary the DM:  There's a bit of nervousness this morning as people are kind of anticipating the new mayor coming in.

02:43 Gary the DM:  There's like first time in generations.

02:47 Gary the DM:  Some people are children are rehearsing songs and things for the event.

02:54 Gary the DM:  There's preparations, but there's some anxiety over what's going to happen, how this will affect the town.

03:01 Gary the DM:  Some believe that. Some believe that this is a bad omen, right? Losing control.

03:07 Gary the DM:  The. The former ruling family is one of them.

03:10 Gary the DM:  They are very reluctant and are skeptical of anything that's happening like this.

03:17 Gary the DM:  Others are thinking like this could be a great opportunity.

03:20 Gary the DM:  The oni are the ruling class.

03:23 Gary the DM:  They can work with this mayor and with the leadership and perhaps raise their station somehow.

03:31 Gary the DM:  So some folks see this as a plus.

03:33 Gary the DM:  Like this could be a great thing for the town and for themselves.

03:36 Gary the DM:  But overall, the town is kind of preparing for this.

03:40 Gary the DM:  This presence. As you guys are walking amongst the town, there's, you know, townsfolk are moving around in different areas.

03:49 Gary the DM:  Is there anything that you guys want to look at, prepare for, or purchase within the town before the.

04:00 Gary the DM:  The process starts? You guys. You guys don't seem to have any, you know, current activity.

04:07 Gary the DM:  There's a, you know, people are moving around and preparing, but for the most part, you guys are.

04:14 Gary the DM:  Have been free to do whatever you wish.

04:18 Gary the DM:  As the town folks move around and close by you, there's.

04:24 Gary the DM:  But it's an opportunity, you know, as the town kind of gears up.

04:27 Gary the DM:  There's a general store in town.

04:30 Gary the DM:  There's a blacksmith. There's several places that you could get.

04:35 Gary the DM:  There's a leather working place. A lot of the.

04:39 Gary the DM:  You may not get things on the shelf.

04:41 Gary the DM:  Like a lot of times they.

04:42 Gary the DM:  They're built, you know, on order because it's a small town and there's not a lot of visitors.

04:48 Gary the DM:  So they don't need to keep a huge, you know, shell shelf of things.

04:52 Gary the DM:  But if there is something you requested that, you know, you could have it built or they may have it

04:56 Gary the DM:  on shelf. So there's the Rebel Leather works.

05:00 Gary the DM:  There's a. A bath house. You could visit the fisheries if you want to get something to eat.

05:07 Gary the DM:  It is early morning, so you can go to the docks or you go to the inn.

05:11 Gary the DM:  There's the several places that you could.

05:16 Gary the DM:  That you can visit.

05:17 Chris as Boon:  There.

05:19 Gary the DM:  There's a lantern shop. The. There's the Cloud Paper Lodge, who they are working frantically to.

05:28 Gary the DM:  To, you know, create like paper lanterns and other things to.

05:31 Gary the DM:  To fill the. This. This area.

05:34 Gary the DM:  The Crooked Carp Tavern is a place you could visit.

05:37 Gary the DM:  But like I said, the. For the most part, the town is.

05:39 Gary the DM:  Is active and anxious for this new arrival to arrive, but it gives you guys an opportunity to venture somewhere.

05:51 Oded as Ginkgo:  Are we like a group already? Are we venturing?

05:55 Gary the DM:  Yeah, for the most part, we'll say you guys have each other and have chatted.

05:59 Gary the DM:  You're concerned about your friend Donkey, who is severely under the weather today.

06:06 Gary the DM:  Um, perhaps you could get. There's a apothecary and healer here.

06:11 Gary the DM:  Could be alchemical stuff. Maybe there's something you can get him to maybe have him heal faster.

06:16 Gary the DM:  But for the most part you guys have arrived in town.

06:20 Gary the DM:  You have some backstories where you know each other that are kind of linked up.

06:25 Gary the DM:  You guys are I guess some skeptical, I guess or not.

06:30 Gary the DM:  Just trying to figure out like what is going on in the town.

06:34 Gary the DM:  You see the. There's kind of the.

06:37 Gary the DM:  The town is on two sides of the riverbank.

06:39 Gary the DM:  So there's a bridge that. A couple bridges that span across it.

06:43 Gary the DM:  So on your side that you guys are on with the main town center, there's a lot of the.

06:49 Gary the DM:  There's like the Mizuki's estate, which was a former wealthy family in town.

06:58 Gary the DM:  They were kicked out and now are staying at a lodge.

07:03 Gary the DM:  The magistrate has taken over that as his place while he's staying here.

07:09 Gary the DM:  And you can see him talking to a few people as he's walking down the riverbank on the opposite side.

07:16 Gary the DM:  He stands out from everybody else, like he says, about 7ft tall, broad and typically wears like samurai style, like

07:24 Gary the DM:  lamelier kind of armor with a very large nodachi kind of sword.

07:29 Gary the DM:  Like a big two handed long sword basically.

07:33 Gary the DM:  Or a massive katana. Basically it's like a double sized katana and very intimidating presence.

07:46 Gary the DM:  Doesn't seem to yell much and doesn't seem like he feels like he has to.

07:50 Gary the DM:  His presence alone seems to command attention.

07:56 Chris as Boon:  Yeah, the black blacksmith sounds good.

07:58 Chris as Boon:  What is the guy's name again? You just mentioned the.

08:04 Chris as Boon:  The tall guy.

08:05 Gary the DM:  Magistrate. Yeah, Magistrate Kurosawa.

08:09 Chris as Boon:  Oh, okay.

08:14 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

08:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I vote, I vote we go to the blacksmith first.

08:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like a more thematic weapon than a short sword.

08:21 Gary the DM:  Okay.

08:25 Chris as Boon:  Absolutely.

08:27 Vic as Littlefinger:  Off we go.

08:29 Gary the DM:  So.

08:36 Gary the DM:  When you go to. You can hear, you know the pinging of a hammer as you get up.

08:42 Gary the DM:  You can. You could get closer.

08:44 Gary the DM:  You can feel the heat of.

08:45 Gary the DM:  Of the. The blacksmith. I can't remember what they call that thing that they use to heat the metal.

08:53 Gary the DM:  And so you can feel the heat coming off of it as it's eternal blaze.

08:57 Gary the DM:  Ironworks is the name of the shop.

08:59 Gary the DM:  So you can get like all kinds of.

09:01 Gary the DM:  You guys have been here a while.

09:02 Gary the DM:  You can get all kinds of metal tools and gear here, possibly weapons.

09:08 Gary the DM:  The gong is the name of the blacksmith.

09:13 Gary the DM:  It's a kitsune who is hammering away and typically can do some weapons.

09:22 Gary the DM:  Not quite an established weaponsmith, but decent armor is something that's probably beyond yong.

09:29 Gary the DM:  But other types of things like weapons that you know and farming instruments are definitely in bridles and barding.

09:38 Gary the DM:  Things like that are definitely available.

09:41 Gary the DM:  But armor is probably something beyond yang.

09:44 Gary the DM:  But smaller types of things you definitely could craft that you walk up.

09:50 Gary the DM:  Yong is like I said Hammering away and seems to be working on what might be some type of larger

10:01 Gary the DM:  sheet. And it's kind of shaping it kind of round.

10:04 Gary the DM:  Could be some type of farting for an animal or steed or possibly maybe even reinforcing of a bow of

10:16 Gary the DM:  a ship or something or a chariot or something.

10:18 Gary the DM:  It doesn't seem like it would be like four personal things.

10:22 Gary the DM:  It's like a larger piece of metal that's kind of shaping it round for.

10:27 Gary the DM:  Seems like doing plates or something.

10:28 Gary the DM:  But it's hammering away frustratingly at this.

10:32 Gary the DM:  This piece of equipment.

10:35 Chris as Boon:  And so I guess we've met already.

10:36 Chris as Boon:  Do you. Do you go by Da or do you go by Baishan?

10:40 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I was thinking Baishan, but if that's difficult, we can always do Da.

10:44 Chris as Boon:  Baishan. What kind of weapon are you looking for?

10:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  If this isn't an orcish.

10:53 Chris as Boon:  Forge.

10:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But I'm. I'm hoping that the esteemed Yang can build me a polearm.

11:00 Chris as Boon:  Oh yeah, I want a pole arm too.

11:05 Chris as Boon:  Yeah, I wanna.

11:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I wanna.

11:07 Chris as Boon:  If I'm. I don't know if I'm saying it right, but I want to just arm, which is like Polar.

11:16 Gary the DM:  Song is tangling away and you guys kind of walk up all together and finally looks up and he's got

11:23 Gary the DM:  like a band on. On his brow is.

11:26 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Still wet as he takes it off and pours it into like a bucket that's near him like cold

11:32 Gary the DM:  water and puts it back into the water.

11:34 Gary the DM:  Kind of pours down his. Down his brow and stands up and he's a young, younger kind of kitsune.

11:45 Gary the DM:  He's a younger kind of kitsune.

11:47 Gary the DM:  Very fit, you know, from, you know, the labor that, that he typically does.

11:51 Gary the DM:  Probably somewhere like you know, 30 year old, late 20s maybe is a inadequate blacksmith.

11:59 Gary the DM:  But you know, but for this area, you know, definitely is device kind of lays down the.

12:04 Gary the DM:  The mallet and looks at the group and says no more orders today.

12:11 Gary the DM:  Please. Like, please don't. You don't have.

12:16 Gary the DM:  Please don't tell me you're. You have more things for our, our glorious magistrate.

12:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Well, don't worry, young. We're not here on behalf of the oni or the magistrate.

12:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I was here on a personal request.

12:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But if you don't have the capacity, I can always return.

12:34 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I understand.

12:38 Gary the DM:  I said I might be. Might be put an order in.

12:41 Chris as Boon:  I don't need it immediately.

12:42 Gary the DM:  Oh that orders. Orders I can take if you can.

12:45 Gary the DM:  If you can wait on the time, give me a day or so to recover.

12:50 Gary the DM:  I'm happy to help. What are we looking.

12:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Are we looking to Order quality takes time.

12:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We understand that. I think we're looking for a fair pollard.

13:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  I have a couple of requests as well after you guys get your order.

13:11 Vic as Littlefinger:  And I would like to add a.

13:12 Gary the DM:  Couple of requests to our order for.

13:13 Chris as Boon:  For myself.

13:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Be a significant order young. Is there, is there anything we can do for you?

13:23 Gary the DM:  Even we're looking at two pole arms.

13:29 Gary the DM:  My. I've only done some simple ones in the past.

13:34 Gary the DM:  More like pikes, I imagine, if you want something else like.

13:40 Gary the DM:  And he goes over, walks away from the forge a bit, goes over to another area, pulls out basically, you

13:46 Gary the DM:  know, a script of paper and puts it down with like a charcoal type pencil.

13:51 Gary the DM:  Basically like a. Just a block of charcoal and starts sketching it like, you know, your Baishan order polearm.

13:58 Gary the DM:  And he goes, if, if you could draw what you want the blade to be.

14:02 Gary the DM:  And there's, there's several styles. Like I've, I've done more of a pike style before.

14:10 Gary the DM:  I'm assuming a wooden pole. If you're looking to craft a metal pole, that might take a little bit longer

14:17 Gary the DM:  but. And it's a little trickier to do for shaping and things.

14:21 Gary the DM:  But if you want a wooden shaft with, you know, metal bladed and.

14:25 Gary the DM:  Or pointed pike, we could do that.

14:29 Gary the DM:  But the hands of the chalkboard about by Sean says could you maybe sketch what you're.

14:36 Gary the DM:  What you're thinking?

14:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, and I'll, I'll sketch out definitely a wooden.

14:42 Braedon as Da Baishan:  A wooden shaft with a. With a blade on the end and then a couple little D rings on the

14:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  shaft so I can hang a pennant from it.

14:51 Gary the DM:  Okay.

14:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  Fancy.

14:54 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

14:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And the blade on the end could look like.

14:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like a cleat almost. But it doesn't have to be anything fancy.

15:04 Chris as Boon:  And I draw a. It's a.

15:05 Chris as Boon:  It's a wooden shaft, curved blade with the hook protruding allows the, allows the wielder to trip opponents at a

15:14 Chris as Boon:  distance. And I sketch something that looks like.

15:20 Chris as Boon:  Well, you sure I can't. I can't paste in roll 20 apparently.

15:25 Chris as Boon:  But it's just a, it's just a polar with a curved blade and a little.

15:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm working on the image.

15:40 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I think you guys can post those up, but I can post it.

15:44 Chris as Boon:  In the general discord. Okay.

15:48 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can do that.

15:50 Chris as Boon:  But it's. Yeah.

16:13 Gary the DM:  Okay, cool.

16:17 Chris as Boon:  Who.

16:17 Gary the DM:  He jots those down and next to those, he basically says.

16:28 Gary the DM:  He scribbles next to the, the bladed cleaver.

16:31 Gary the DM:  That's by Sean's ten gold pieces.

16:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The steep price, but if the quality is there, I can make that work.

16:46 Gary the DM:  And he looks over the hooks blade as well.

16:48 Gary the DM:  And writes down the same tentle pieces for you as well.

16:51 Gary the DM:  Boom.

16:55 Chris as Boon:  More than I've got. I do have a longsword that I can trade you if you can reduce the price.

17:04 Gary the DM:  Give me a.

17:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Skill check.

17:14 Gary the DM:  Give me a. I guess a diplomacy check.

17:19 Chris as Boon:  All right.

17:20 Vic as Littlefinger:  Oh, nice, nice. Let's see how that charm works.

17:26 Chris as Boon:  Skills. There we are. Diplomacy. A mighty plus zero.

17:33 Chris as Boon:  15.

17:34 Braedon as Da Baishan:  15.

17:34 Gary the DM:  Okay.

17:37 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

17:40 Gary the DM:  Can I. Can I look at the long sword first?

17:44 Chris as Boon:  Yeah. I take it out.

17:45 Gary the DM:  Okay. Kind of inspects it a little bit.

17:47 Gary the DM:  Feels the weight and the balance of it.

17:50 Gary the DM:  And he says long sword. And how about regal pieces?

17:59 Chris as Boon:  Sounds good.

18:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So Yong, since we're doing kind of a bulk order here, the two polearms and whatever Littlefinger wants, I'll throw

18:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  in a short sword as well.

18:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Maybe we can do a group price.

18:13 Gary the DM:  Group price, he said. Well, I can maybe give you a discount with the short sword if I take a

18:22 Gary the DM:  look at it. Probably only worth a few gold pieces.

18:25 Gary the DM:  So would you say seven gold pieces in the short sword?

18:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right. I see. I see what's going on here.

18:35 Gary the DM:  I'm not sure what Littlefinger here wants.

18:39 Gary the DM:  Could be difficult.

18:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  Well, you know, actually I don't.

18:43 Vic as Littlefinger:  I don't think for a man of your skill that this would be difficult.

18:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  The first thing I'm looking for is called a SAP.

18:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  Kind of like a big sack of nickels, you know.

18:51 Vic as Littlefinger:  I just need a good heavy SAP.

18:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  It makes me feel comfortable to have something like that on my person.

18:57 Vic as Littlefinger:  And then I'm. I'm also hoping to pick up some shuriken.

19:02 Vic as Littlefinger:  I need a. I need a couple packs of throwing stars to have just.

19:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  Just in case things get ugly or.

19:09 Vic as Littlefinger:  You know, sometimes I just like to.

19:11 Vic as Littlefinger:  To make sure I've got a little extra protection with me.

19:13 Chris as Boon:  So my.

19:14 Vic as Littlefinger:  My request is pretty simple.

19:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You know, Littlefinger, I have a SAP.

19:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  If you have something worthy of trading, I might be able to part with it.

19:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  This is an orcish SAP from.

19:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  From the White Mountain. And it'd be large in your hands.

19:34 Vic as Littlefinger:  No, no doubt that's true. As long as there is no problems with me wheeling that.

19:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's a great idea. I'm not sure that I've got anything that would be of interest.

19:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  To.

19:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  To a detective. You look too big to climb stuff.

19:54 Vic as Littlefinger:  So you probably don't want that climbing kit.

19:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't need it actually. But any like dagger, any single handed weapon you'd be willing to trade.

20:04 Vic as Littlefinger:  I do have a dagger. I do certainly have a dagger if that's.

20:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's of interest to you and that way that would let me keep a hand free to to throw my

20:12 Vic as Littlefinger:  shurukin if needed while I wield my.

20:14 Vic as Littlefinger:  My rapier.

20:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'd be willing to do that.

20:19 Vic as Littlefinger:  We can.

20:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We can do that.

20:20 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I just need to purchase here at the blacksmith today.

20:23 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm just hoping to pick up some.

20:24 Gary the DM:  Shuruk and then give me a diplomacy check.

20:29 Gary the DM:  Little finger. And Yong says that the.

20:35 Gary the DM:  The SAP is more on the leather works than something that I would like.

20:39 Gary the DM:  But

20:43 Gary the DM:  the 11. Okay.

20:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No that was me.

20:50 Gary the DM:  He he smiles a little bit though and he says

20:57 Gary the DM:  tell you what Littlefinger.

21:02 Gary the DM:  You know and tied to some of the foundations of our town.

21:08 Gary the DM:  And it so happens that my my son how is a.

21:13 Gary the DM:  A fan of of a shuriken and I've already created.

21:19 Gary the DM:  I already had several of them I was going to to give him happen to have four of them here.

21:28 Gary the DM:  Two gold pieces and they're yours.

21:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's a pretty steep price.

21:36 Vic as Littlefinger:  But as as my my friend the cop over there said we pay for quality so I'll take them

21:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  by Sean. I would.

21:51 Gary the DM:  So do you guys kind of trade trade coins and you get get your orders in? He says in a

21:59 Gary the DM:  few days he'll have the in a few days to get the the blades created based on the sketches.

22:10 Gary the DM:  Thinks he has a good idea of what you guys are doing.

22:12 Gary the DM:  But he's kind of swapped with some work that that the magistrate has given him and is.

22:18 Gary the DM:  You know one when they get back is as he's about to turn around he picks up his.

22:24 Gary the DM:  His hammer and all of a sudden there's a decent sized explosion nearby.

22:30 Gary the DM:  Not only is an explosion but you hear like a whistling sound and another couple explosions followed by several like

22:37 Gary the DM:  quick explosions. Afterward you turn around and so does Yang as he looks towards the.

22:45 Gary the DM:  Towards the dock area and one of.

22:48 Vic as Littlefinger:  The.

22:51 Gary the DM:  Warehouse buildings that's off the docks that kind of unload riverboat ships and things like that that come in is

22:59 Gary the DM:  on fire. You can see it on the roof and some of the windows on fire as fireworks and others

23:05 Gary the DM:  kind of spurt out out of it.

23:07 Gary the DM:  And the. You can see a couple people that are nearby immediately rush to it and they start doing like

23:15 Gary the DM:  a bucket brigade. But the fire is like a few more explosions happen as you know side of the wall

23:22 Gary the DM:  kind of catches on fire as more of the fireworks that have been loaded there for the festival have caught

23:28 Gary the DM:  on fire. Then you hear please help.

23:35 Gary the DM:  There's someone trapped inside and a few other people.

23:39 Gary the DM:  You can see more people kind of rush to try to put out the Flames as they continue to escalate.

23:46 Gary the DM:  It's about maybe 50 yards from you guys as this building starts to continue to get engulfed in flames.

23:56 Chris as Boon:  Start jogging that way? Yep.

24:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Are we able to like. Am I able to discern.

24:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Was it like fireworks that went off? Was it.

24:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Did it sound like a staged explosive?

24:10 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Let's see. You. You have that investigation ability, right? I don't remember how that works.

24:21 Gary the DM:  I think you can claim an investigation based on evidence or something, you see.

24:24 Gary the DM:  Right.

24:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. I've got a couple feats that may play in, like expeditious inspection.

24:30 Gary the DM:  Right. I guess from. I guess that would count, I think if you got to the scene and saw like

24:39 Gary the DM:  the aftermath, like how big the fire is or like maybe where it started.

24:42 Gary the DM:  But I think, let's see, based on.

24:44 Chris as Boon:  Sound.

24:47 Gary the DM:  Or do you have any lore with explosives or something that would be along those lines to understand, like, how

24:56 Gary the DM:  different explosions may have happened?

24:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I do have underworld lore.

25:02 Gary the DM:  Underworld. I think that's more on like, you're good at getting.

25:08 Gary the DM:  Working with like, gangs, mob, their like affiliation, where to buy drugs.

25:15 Gary the DM:  You'd probably be good at stuff like that.

25:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Maybe.

25:19 Gary the DM:  Any like, warfare. Any folks who have like, warfare skills or combat, kind of like siege warfare and things like

25:26 Gary the DM:  that.

25:27 Chris as Boon:  I. I've got warfare lore. Somebody else might as well.

25:31 Chris as Boon:  But I mean, I can just roll a thing.

25:33 Chris as Boon:  Roll a check here. 20.

25:36 Gary the DM:  Oh, 20.

25:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  Boone, I think it's a great idea for the big fighter to run in front towards the fire.

25:43 Vic as Littlefinger:  I will.

25:43 Chris as Boon:  So. So I started jogging toward it and I'm thinking, like, have I ever heard anything like this before? Does

25:48 Chris as Boon:  this remind me of anything? I rolled a 20 on it.

25:50 Gary the DM:  That's pretty good.

25:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah.

25:52 Gary the DM:  So. So Boone, the big fighter who's like half everybody's size, I think is running toward it.

25:58 Gary the DM:  Actually. I don't know how big Aleshi is or.

26:00 Gary the DM:  You're halfling, aren't you?

26:01 Chris as Boon:  So the same as. As our rogue.

26:04 Chris as Boon:  I think.

26:05 Gary the DM:  I think. I'm not sure we both halflings.

26:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's great.

26:07 Chris as Boon:  I'm a dwarf, so I'm not sure how those compare.

26:12 Gary the DM:  So you guys are. Are running towards this, towards the burning building.

26:18 Gary the DM:  So you heard. So, Boone, there's definitely fireworks going off.

26:23 Gary the DM:  Those are probably, you would say secondary first explosion was.

26:30 Oded as Ginkgo:  You.

26:31 Gary the DM:  Sounds more like a siege engine, you know, gunpowder type explosion.

26:36 Gary the DM:  I guess it could be a firework, but it would have been a massive one.

26:40 Gary the DM:  The rest of them sound more like you hear the whistles of like bottle rocket, kind of know, bitten light

26:45 Gary the DM:  off firecrackers and other things. And then The.

26:48 Gary the DM:  I guess the other thing, as you're running toward it, the speed of the building going up is also alarming.

26:56 Gary the DM:  It's near water as well. So it's not like super dry or anything like that, but.

27:03 Chris as Boon:  Okay. So I'm thinking like this was.

27:05 Chris as Boon:  This was an explosion. Somebody did this.

27:08 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

27:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  Do we see anyone, like trapped inside or anything?

27:15 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Give me a presence check.

27:16 Gary the DM:  I think that's what they call it in this game.

27:18 Oded as Ginkgo:  Presence.

27:20 Chris as Boon:  Presence.

27:22 Gary the DM:  Wait.

27:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let'S see. Perception.

27:26 Gary the DM:  Perception. There we go.

27:30 Chris as Boon:  Can. Can you describe what our Leshy friend.

27:32 Gary the DM:  Looks like he should describe? Well, how do you look?

27:36 Oded as Ginkgo:  So Ginko is. He looks like he's lean and kind of.

27:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Kind of muscular, but not ripped.

27:45 Oded as Ginkgo:  The muscles look more like, you know, roots than.

27:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Than muscles. And he's shaped at all.

27:53 Chris as Boon:  He's what, like a piece of broccoli or something?

27:55 Oded as Ginkgo:  He is a humanoid shape with like a mushroom cap.

28:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  And he, he looks like he's.

28:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  He's not intimidating or anything, but he does look like he's seen some stuff.

28:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  He looks like a veteran. Right?

28:11 Gary the DM:  How tall?

28:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like how tall?

28:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  I would say like five feet, maybe.

28:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay, that's a big mushroom.

28:24 Chris as Boon:  Three little guys and a giant.

28:31 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's fantastic.

28:34 Chris as Boon:  Somebody rolled giant perception checks. Yeah, see, I see that.

28:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I accidentally clicked it twice. The 24.

28:42 Oded as Ginkgo:  I rolled the 20 as well.

28:45 Gary the DM:  Okay. Yeah. So Littlefinger, actually, see, you rolled twice.

28:57 Gary the DM:  I guess you did. Okay. You roll the 24 and 22.

29:03 Gary the DM:  Everybody roll really well.

29:06 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

29:06 Gary the DM:  And I think the numbers here are a little bit higher than the D D ones, if you guys remember.

29:11 Gary the DM:  So like, like 20 is because you guys see your first level, you're rolling like plus sixes and things like

29:18 Gary the DM:  that on these rolls. But as you guys get close, you can hear.

29:24 Gary the DM:  You don't see anybody like the.

29:26 Gary the DM:  There's not a lot of windows in the warehouse.

29:28 Gary the DM:  There's a few. There's a big door on the.

29:31 Gary the DM:  So on the north side. So the south side is where the river is and the north side is where

29:37 Gary the DM:  kind of these double doors would be for, like where they're unloading, loading quite a few things right now.

29:43 Gary the DM:  Those doors are. Are closed. You can see the smoke and stuff coming out from those.

29:49 Gary the DM:  And it looks like a two story kind of building.

29:54 Gary the DM:  It's pretty tall. There's a couple other rooms in this as like there's a loading dock and then there's like

30:00 Gary the DM:  a storage area and then like where they would transition things to like land travel.

30:05 Gary the DM:  So it's one of the bigger warehouses in Willow Shore.

30:11 Gary the DM:  You can't see anybody you can see flames and smoke coming out, but you hear some voices.

30:16 Gary the DM:  Sounds like at least two voices.

30:19 Gary the DM:  They sound young. You can hear them like, help me.

30:23 Gary the DM:  Help get me out of here.

30:26 Gary the DM:  We're trapped. And it sounds like a young boy, maybe young girl, maybe two boys, two girls.

30:32 Gary the DM:  It's hard to tell, but you can hear them yelling inside.

30:38 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right, Ginkgo wants to go in.

30:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, we've got to get in there.

30:43 Chris as Boon:  I'll go in as well.

30:47 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm on board, but we need to be careful.

30:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  There's. Something's up.

30:52 Chris as Boon:  Something's up. And for the record, I am fire resistant as a dwarf.

30:57 Chris as Boon:  A forged dwarf. Nice.

31:00 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right, I'll let you lead the way.

31:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

31:05 Chris as Boon:  All right, we go in.

31:12 Gary the DM:  Can you guys see this map? It should be blacked out for most of it, but what you guys can

31:16 Gary the DM:  see.

31:20 Chris as Boon:  Okay. I had to adjust the size, but.

31:23 Gary the DM:  Yeah, there's lingual finger. We'll get some actual tokens here that work better, but I'll create some for you guys.

31:35 Gary the DM:  So this is the. You guys open these doors on the.

31:38 Gary the DM:  On the north side, which is where you guys are, right where Littlefinger is, as well as Boone.

31:45 Gary the DM:  You guys are all kind of huddle around.

31:47 Gary the DM:  You pull those doors.

31:47 Vic as Littlefinger:  They.

31:48 Gary the DM:  They basically swing open. You know, they're kind of like barn doors.

31:51 Gary the DM:  So they swing open. You open them enough, and inside, you feel the heat and smoke just build out of

31:56 Gary the DM:  this place. As you look in, you can see fire in different areas, kind of like that's scattered around.

32:03 Gary the DM:  Can you guys see the red in there or no? Is that color for two?

32:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No, we just see the top left corner.

32:09 Gary the DM:  Okay. So as you look in, I'll reveal them all for you guys.

32:27 Gary the DM:  This is a little better.

32:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

32:29 Gary the DM:  So inside there, you can see, you know, the fire has kind of caught on boxes and other things.

32:36 Gary the DM:  It's raging right in front of you there.

32:38 Gary the DM:  As you look further past, I'll give you guys a little bit more distance here.

32:43 Gary the DM:  Go over here. You can kind of see that there's fire in different areas.

32:49 Gary the DM:  As it didn't seem like it was one location that this fire started.

32:54 Gary the DM:  It's kind of started to spread all over at this point, you don't see anybody, but you hear them coming

32:59 Gary the DM:  from somewhere, somewhere inside. Probably like back in this area, back over here, maybe.

33:09 Gary the DM:  They seem to be trapped on the other side of the building, basically.

33:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is the door locked or is it opening? We can go in.

33:19 Gary the DM:  Yeah, the top door that you guys are at, which is right here.

33:24 Gary the DM:  So this. This is a door right here.

33:35 Gary the DM:  So, like, this Is the door that's open right there.

33:40 Gary the DM:  You see that blue box? All right, so, yeah, that's open.

33:44 Gary the DM:  That you guys open that Kind of, like, you pulled it open a little bit.

33:47 Gary the DM:  As you guys are peering in, smoke is making it difficult to see.

33:51 Gary the DM:  So it's very smoky in here.

33:55 Gary the DM:  You can see blazing fire there ahead of you right now.

33:59 Gary the DM:  You can hear them as you call out, and they are calling out like, please, we're trapped.

34:03 Gary the DM:  Get us out somewhere in the south side of this building.

34:09 Vic as Littlefinger:  All right, so I'm in the front, and I've got.

34:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm a thief who has good.

34:18 Vic as Littlefinger:  Where is it? Stealth skills. So I want to kind of come in and start to move.

34:25 Vic as Littlefinger:  Like, I don't know if you can see me moving the character.

34:28 Vic as Littlefinger:  The tile or not, but, like, I don't.

34:29 Vic as Littlefinger:  And I don't know how far I'm allowed to move in, but, like, I want to come in and start

34:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  to move along the inside wall here.

34:34 Vic as Littlefinger:  Like this.

34:36 Chris as Boon:  Oh, yeah.

34:37 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I can get a better view a little bit and stay close to the wall where I'm.

34:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm still. I got multiple exit points and st Stuff there.

34:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right?

34:44 Gary the DM:  So, like, okay, are you with stealth? Are you trying to avoid people seeing or hearing you or.

34:54 Gary the DM:  Or you just.

34:56 Vic as Littlefinger:  I want to see what's going on before somebody knows I'm there.

34:59 Vic as Littlefinger:  Running around in a burning building.

35:01 Gary the DM:  Like, okay, okay.

35:03 Vic as Littlefinger:  Seems weird. We're walking around town.

35:05 Vic as Littlefinger:  Building blows up and stuff. I'm just being careful here.

35:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  The rest of the guys can come barreling in whenever they want.

35:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm.

35:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm gonna be a little careful.

35:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm Step out the door and make sure no one comes in after us.

35:16 Gary the DM:  Okay.

35:17 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah. And I. I'm not sure how far to move in one fell swoop, like.

35:22 Gary the DM:  So you can move 30ft. And so this little ruler, actually, I think it's supposed to measure you every time.

35:30 Gary the DM:  Now, that was 15. Yeah. See, it.

35:34 Gary the DM:  It measures you every time you move 15.

35:37 Gary the DM:  So you still have 15 more feet you can move.

35:38 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can go there.

35:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think I'm gonna hold it up right there.

35:43 Gary the DM:  Okay. Give me your stealth check.

35:45 Gary the DM:  Skill.

35:51 Gary the DM:  Basically, you have to beat what the.

35:53 Gary the DM:  If anybody else is looking for, you roll.

36:07 Gary the DM:  Eighteen.

36:08 Chris as Boon:  All right.

36:10 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

36:10 Gary the DM:  So little finger sneaks in. You guys lose track.

36:13 Gary the DM:  A little finger pretty quickly. One, he's being sneaky, avoiding kind of, like, main lines of sight.

36:18 Gary the DM:  And the smoke kind of fills in this area.

36:21 Gary the DM:  And little finger, give me a perception check,

36:28 Gary the DM:  and it'll be a high difficulty because it's hard to see.

36:32 Gary the DM:  Okay.

36:37 Gary the DM:  So you can't see them yet, but there seems to be like right here.

36:44 Gary the DM:  Do you see where that. You guys see where that little circle kind of.

36:50 Gary the DM:  You hear a kid call out? Sounds like a young boy calling out right from there.

36:57 Gary the DM:  Help me, dad. Help me. And he sounds fairly close.

37:01 Gary the DM:  Like behind this wall of. Well, you can't see the wall there, but there's a stack of, you know, boxes

37:13 Gary the DM:  and things like that, dry goods and other stuff, you know, kind of stored in this storage shed.

37:21 Gary the DM:  But he. He seems close. He's much closer than before.

37:23 Gary the DM:  He may have journeyed up this way or that's where he was originally just hiding.

37:27 Gary the DM:  But he's like about there probably, maybe.

37:29 Gary the DM:  Was that 30 or 40ft?

37:30 Chris as Boon:  Like.

37:31 Gary the DM:  Yeah, about 30ft away from him.

37:33 Gary the DM:  We got. Myan is staying at the doorway.

37:39 Gary the DM:  Go. And Boone. What are you guys doing?

37:43 Chris as Boon:  I am running toward the nearest voice I hear, so I'll try to move.

37:49 Chris as Boon:  I mean, I only have 20.

37:51 Chris as Boon:  20 movements, so I can move like.

37:53 Gary the DM:  You're short. Oh, wait, you might only have 20 movement.

37:58 Gary the DM:  You're half. You're halfling. You might be further back than that, but we'll do that next time.

38:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Vic, what does your speed say on your character sheet?

38:13 Vic as Littlefinger:  25Ft. 25ft.

38:15 Gary the DM:  So you're one square further back.

38:18 Gary the DM:  You're probably here.

38:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Here.

38:23 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

38:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  Genka is. Is following Littlefinger because Littlefinger seems like he knows what he's doing.

38:32 Gary the DM:  Okay, give me. Give me a perception check.

38:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah, I'm.

38:42 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

38:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm trying. My windows are messed up.

38:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  Just sec.

38:51 Chris as Boon:  Right.

39:24 Gary the DM:  Chris.

39:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We can all study his room, see what we can learn about him.

39:32 Gary the DM:  I know, but that's got some amazing plants going on.

39:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Every week they like, grow. I swear there's more of them.

39:41 Gary the DM:  I think. I think these are all fake plants.

39:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  You'll never know.

39:45 Gary the DM:  It's an AI generated background every single time.

39:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  So I. I click perception and then what? Like I.

39:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  How do I roll perception? Maybe I'm missing something.

39:59 Gary the DM:  Let me see.

40:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  If you click where inside the magnifying glass, the number.

40:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It should roll for you.

40:09 Gary the DM:  Oh, there we go. 23. Okay.

40:12 Gary the DM:  So you can see Littlefinder sneaking around, but you're quickly following him.

40:19 Gary the DM:  Even in the smoke. You're able to kind of pick them up periodically.

40:23 Gary the DM:  So you. You follow them into that.

40:25 Gary the DM:  That corner there. And then.

40:34 Gary the DM:  You can hear a voice of coming from the.

40:38 Gary the DM:  Right around here that everybody's kind of heading to so far.

40:42 Gary the DM:  And then there's one that's even further back over here.

40:50 Gary the DM:  You guys are further in. Now we will reveal there's There's a fire blazing over here in that corner.

41:01 Gary the DM:  This is like a wall of boxes and things.

41:07 Gary the DM:  As you guys can see, we're on to this area now.

41:11 Gary the DM:  We'll go back, Littlefinger. So you can see there's a raging fire.

41:17 Gary the DM:  It's a blaze there to your right or to your left if you're facing south or down.

41:22 Gary the DM:  And then there's a smaller kind of fire brewing in the center there.

41:27 Gary the DM:  The. That wall that is shown up there is not quite floor to ceiling, but it's.

41:33 Gary the DM:  It's several shelves high of, like, stacked crates and other types of dry goods and things.

41:39 Gary the DM:  And on the other side of that, from your perception check before, right around here, is where you think you

41:45 Gary the DM:  heard that boy yell out,

41:52 Gary the DM:  Okay.

42:00 Oded as Ginkgo:  What would.

42:00 Gary the DM:  You like to do, Little Finger?

42:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I think I'm going to keep moving in,

42:13 Vic as Littlefinger:  You know, So I got Boone and Ginkgo right behind me, and I got Day Bashan guarding the door.

42:22 Vic as Littlefinger:  Right. I'm going to stay low to the ground because the smoke is coming in.

42:25 Vic as Littlefinger:  Even though I'm already low to the ground, I like to stay safe.

42:30 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm going to. I'm going to start moving.

42:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  I got 25ft, right. That voice is back there.

42:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  But I want to stay far away from that fire on that side.

42:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  So.

42:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think I'm going to.

42:51 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think I like it right here.

42:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  Actually, that's not true. I like it right here, but I got something against one side of me there, so

43:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm not getting. Taking a look around.

43:03 Vic as Littlefinger:  Take another look around and see if I can see anybody.

43:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  If I can hear the voices better or get a better direction or see where I can then guide my

43:11 Vic as Littlefinger:  partners coming in behind me.

43:16 Gary the DM:  Give me first a acrobatics check.

43:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can I give Littlefinger guidance or does it have to be, like, in my turn?

43:32 Gary the DM:  I think we can give him.

43:34 Gary the DM:  Good question. I think that's technically on your turn.

43:40 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is this.

43:42 Gary the DM:  Is this your ability or is it the spell?

43:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  This is a can. Trip.

43:46 Gary the DM:  Cantrip. Yeah, it would be on your turn, I think, to give them guidance.

43:50 Gary the DM:  Okay, let's. It says it's a reaction.

43:54 Oded as Ginkgo:  It does not say it's a reaction.

43:56 Chris as Boon:  No.

43:56 Gary the DM:  Okay, so, yeah, so it's probably a single action thing.

44:01 Gary the DM:  Oh, we're actually doing this all around, too.

44:03 Gary the DM:  Anyway, go ahead. I forgot everybody gets three.

44:07 Gary the DM:  Three actions. A turn.

44:09 Chris as Boon:  Oh, yeah.

44:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right.

44:11 Gary the DM:  And movement is just one of those.

44:14 Gary the DM:  So you actually can move a lot further than this.

44:19 Gary the DM:  So sorry. I'm falling back to the old ways.

44:21 Chris as Boon:  Of D and D. We can just jump into that.

44:24 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

44:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  So.

44:28 Gary the DM:  Acrobatics at 14. Okay. So in that fire that's in front of you, Littlefinger, all of a sudden you.

44:35 Gary the DM:  As you're running up, you hear kind of a hissing sound.

44:38 Chris as Boon:  And.

44:41 Gary the DM:  Right in front of you, all of a sudden, these rockets shoot off.

44:43 Gary the DM:  There's another kind of firework explosion kicks off.

44:47 Gary the DM:  Unfortunately, you weren't able to get out of the way in time.

44:54 Gary the DM:  You took three points of damage from the rocket hitting you.

44:59 Gary the DM:  There are several as it explodes there.

45:01 Gary the DM:  And the fire will spread which direction?

45:08 Chris as Boon:  4.

45:18 Gary the DM:  All right, so you moved your 25ft.

45:22 Gary the DM:  That's your first action. You have two more to do.

45:29 Vic as Littlefinger:  Okay.

45:31 Gary the DM:  So you can move again. You can do, like, a weight if you want.

45:34 Gary the DM:  You can hold your action.

45:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  Can I, like, do, like, a seek type action to try to see where I should be heading next or

45:44 Vic as Littlefinger:  see what else I can see? Now that I've gotten up here, take a look around.

45:47 Vic as Littlefinger:  Let's maybe get a better view of where these people are yelling from.

45:50 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can definitely do a perception to kind of do, like, assess your surroundings.

45:58 Gary the DM:  Yeah. If you want to do that skill check, you can.

46:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  Would that be a perception check?

46:02 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah.

46:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  The dice roll super easy. This integration is super cool.

46:12 Gary the DM:  So the. The fire is raging, and through this fire, you can see a kid for the first time.

46:22 Gary the DM:  I'll use this.

46:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  He seems to be.

46:32 Gary the DM:  He's holding his hands up, cowering down.

46:35 Gary the DM:  I would say crawling, but definitely stooped over.

46:38 Gary the DM:  You know, I cover his head and his eyes.

46:40 Gary the DM:  Hands are up, protecting his head and eyes.

46:43 Vic as Littlefinger:  Is.

46:44 Gary the DM:  He's wandering around a little bit.

46:46 Gary the DM:  He's trying to get away from the fire.

46:48 Gary the DM:  Looks like he's walking away from you now.

46:50 Gary the DM:  He's going from north to south.

46:51 Gary the DM:  Oh, you can't see him.

47:02 Gary the DM:  You see him there kind of through the fire.

47:04 Gary the DM:  I mean, through the things as.

47:06 Gary the DM:  As the flames are flickering around and starting to grow.

47:09 Gary the DM:  But they burned out some of the boxes and other crates that are in the area.

47:13 Gary the DM:  And through that flame yourself there, you see him walking.

47:17 Gary the DM:  He's got his hands covered. He's protect.

47:19 Gary the DM:  Trying to protect himself. Seems lost as he's wandering around.

47:23 Gary the DM:  You can see he's kind of dingy and soot covered a bit, but it's moving from north to south.

47:33 Vic as Littlefinger:  North is just up.

47:35 Gary the DM:  Yeah, North. I'm just fuses up.

47:37 Chris as Boon:  Yep.

47:42 Gary the DM:  We got

47:46 Gary the DM:  boom.

47:49 Chris as Boon:  So. So I got.

47:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That was.

47:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  Was that two actions, or is there a third action that I then take?

47:56 Gary the DM:  So let's see.

47:56 Chris as Boon:  You did.

47:57 Gary the DM:  You did a move. Yeah. Oh, I guess you.

47:59 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you have one more. Sorry, my bad.

48:04 Gary the DM:  You can do a move or something else if you want.

48:07 Vic as Littlefinger:  These are. Are shelves and stuff right here in front.

48:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right?

48:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  Like.

48:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

48:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  Like we gotta come around to get into here, Right? Like we gotta come around.

48:21 Gary the DM:  You do. You can try to go over them.

48:23 Gary the DM:  Like I said, they don't go to the ceiling, so you could climb them.

48:25 Gary the DM:  You know, if you use like an acrobatics to kind of leap over, you could do that.

48:31 Gary the DM:  But otherwise you gotta go around them.

48:32 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

48:35 Chris as Boon:  And.

48:36 Gary the DM:  Or you could. Athletics would be a climbing.

48:37 Gary the DM:  Sorry, not acrobatic.

48:44 Vic as Littlefinger:  All right, so that's exactly what I'm going to try to do.

48:48 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm going to try to get up here to where I can get in and see this person.

48:52 Gary the DM:  Okay, are you're going to climb the stacks there in front of you over there?

48:56 Chris as Boon:  Okay, cool. Yeah. All right.

48:59 Gary the DM:  Give me an athletics check. And you need a.

49:05 Gary the DM:  A 14.

49:12 Gary the DM:  All right, here we go.

49:17 Chris as Boon:  All right.

49:18 Gary the DM:  So you guys. You guys see Little Thunder start climbing, you know, parkouring up the.

49:24 Gary the DM:  Up the side when one of the shelves that he puts his foot on just gives way and cracks away

49:31 Gary the DM:  as he tumbles down. And you're at the base of this one here, not on top, unfortunately.

49:41 Gary the DM:  But you only took one point of damage.

49:48 Chris as Boon:  All right.

49:48 Gary the DM:  Boom, you're up.

49:51 Chris as Boon:  All right. I. Littlefinger's well on top of that situation.

49:56 Chris as Boon:  So I'm headed over toward the other voice to the south.

50:01 Chris as Boon:  I'm trying to see if I can.

50:06 Chris as Boon:  I mean, would I need to go around this shelf or.

50:13 Chris as Boon:  10ft, 15ft, 20ft? I guess I'll go there for my first move because I'm just going south, I guess.

50:22 Gary the DM:  Right?

50:23 Chris as Boon:  Yes, yes, that's one. And then I'm going to keep going.

50:28 Chris as Boon:  That is right in the fire.

50:30 Chris as Boon:  I guess I will. I want to try to leap over this shelf and land right there.

50:40 Gary the DM:  Land where? Gotcha. Over there.

50:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  Okay.

50:43 Chris as Boon:  Yeah, Yep.

50:46 Gary the DM:  To climb over it and find the other side.

50:49 Gary the DM:  Okay, so that'll be athletics check.

50:50 Gary the DM:  Similar to what?

50:54 Chris as Boon:  All right.

50:55 Gary the DM:  And you have the same number, 27.

50:59 Gary the DM:  Okay. So Boone rapidly climbs over.

51:03 Gary the DM:  This dwarf is used to climb and scampers.

51:06 Chris as Boon:  That was a natural 20.

51:07 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah, that was good. And you're on the other side easily parkouring over the top of the shelf as

51:14 Gary the DM:  you're on the other side of this fire.

51:17 Gary the DM:  The voice again came from like, over here.

51:21 Gary the DM:  The other voice. You actually see this boy over here too, though, through the flames.

51:28 Chris as Boon:  Okay, I see the boy. And then is more revealed to the south here.

51:32 Gary the DM:  Oh, yeah.

51:33 Chris as Boon:  That I'm down here.

51:35 Vic as Littlefinger:  And where. Where was the other voice Again, I missed the ping.

51:39 Gary the DM:  It was over here. Got it.

51:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  Zoom out a bit.

51:47 Chris as Boon:  Thank you. This is just me testing the ping.

51:49 Chris as Boon:  Oh, I can ping too. Okay.

51:51 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Everybody, if you just hold it for a while.

51:55 Chris as Boon:  So, yeah, I feel like Littlefinger's got.

51:57 Chris as Boon:  He's gonna get that boy. So whatever.

51:58 Chris as Boon:  I'm gonna keep going south here.

52:01 Chris as Boon:  So third move. I'll just move next to the shelf.

52:06 Chris as Boon:  Can get a little bit further.

52:09 Vic as Littlefinger:  It does dawn on me that separating a building full of fire might be.

52:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  An idea for us. Yeah, I'm getting nervous.

52:16 Gary the DM:  Are you jumping over the other one?

52:19 Chris as Boon:  I. I can't tell. Like, there's this black area here, and I can't tell if that was it, like a

52:24 Chris as Boon:  hallway or if I needed to jump over something.

52:27 Gary the DM:  So there's.

52:29 Chris as Boon:  Oh, there's something there. Okay.

52:31 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah. So as you get to this section here, you can see.

52:35 Chris as Boon:  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff there.

52:37 Chris as Boon:  I mean, I guess I'll try to jump over it.

52:41 Chris as Boon:  Athletics 19:19.

52:44 Gary the DM:  Okay, so you clear that one as well.

52:47 Gary the DM:  And so you can see from this section down,

52:54 Gary the DM:  You probably see in that corner.

52:55 Chris as Boon:  And that would.

53:02 Vic as Littlefinger:  As.

53:04 Gary the DM:  You see a young girl just cowering.

53:09 Gary the DM:  She's got her head down, like, basically, you know, in almost a fetal position.

53:13 Gary the DM:  But she's. You know, her. She's got her kind of like the.

53:18 Gary the DM:  The old knees with head between your knees kind of stance that's supposed to survive a nuclear blast like that.

53:26 Gary the DM:  She's just kind of like. She seems like she doesn't know what to do.

53:31 Gary the DM:  She's. You can hear her, like, lightly whimpering and crying, but she's not falling out.

53:38 Gary the DM:  She doesn't. She seems like. Like in shock almost.

53:42 Gary the DM:  She's just in a ball at the.

53:44 Gary the DM:  At the base of the floor there.

53:46 Gary the DM:  The fire is getting closer, starting to rage even hotter, but she doesn't seem to be doing anything but just

53:52 Gary the DM:  hiding and not moving where she is from where she is right now.

53:58 Gary the DM:  Ginkgo, you're up.

54:00 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right, so one move I'll do here.

54:08 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can I already see the kid?

54:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that's in front.

54:13 Gary the DM:  Yep.

54:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, if. If I shout, does he.

54:16 Oded as Ginkgo:  Will he hear me, or is there, like, a lot of noise?

54:20 Gary the DM:  I mean, there's some noise, but if you shout, he could definitely hear you.

54:24 Gary the DM:  Yeah, it's not enough where that.

54:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right, you know what? In any case, I'm gonna use a message just so he hears me clearly.

54:33 Oded as Ginkgo:  And I'm gonna tell him, like, point him to me and say, come towards us.

54:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  And he can say something back if.

54:42 Gary the DM:  You once there's no role or anything.

54:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right.

54:46 Gary the DM:  It's just.

54:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

54:50 Gary the DM:  He, he turns

54:56 Gary the DM:  and he says this way.

55:00 Oded as Ginkgo:  Is it, is he turning towards me?

55:03 Gary the DM:  Yeah, he's walking, yes, basically towards the north there.

55:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yes.

55:08 Gary the DM:  Okay. So he journeys up here and he's on the other side of this thing and he's kind of, you

55:14 Gary the DM:  can see his fingers and see his face kind of peer through.

55:18 Gary the DM:  Little finger. You're on the floor there kind of looking up and you can see some box slightly move as

55:24 Gary the DM:  this boy's young face, it's darkened from like soot or ashes and other things and smoke inhalations.

55:31 Gary the DM:  He's coughing a little bit and is trying to pull, pull across.

55:36 Gary the DM:  He doesn't seem like he can get wide enough to fit through, but he's trying to get through this opening

55:43 Gary the DM:  or create an opening there right in front of you.

55:44 Gary the DM:  Little finger. Okay, see that's two actions for you, I think.

55:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah. Last action. I'm going to give little finger guidance.

55:52 Oded as Ginkgo:  This gives you plus one on a roll that you choose.

55:58 Chris as Boon:  Okay. Take it.

56:01 Gary the DM:  That was on.

56:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I think, I think I'm gonna move in slightly.

56:08 Gary the DM:  Okay.

56:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Stay clear of the fire. But I think I'll come.

56:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh God. What just happened? I'll come like here and then I'd like to use my apothecary kit to mix

56:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  up some medic.

56:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like some burn cream.

56:30 Gary the DM:  Okay.

56:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Just the kids are, are injured.

56:34 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

56:36 Gary the DM:  Let'S see. I guess that would be a, essentially a crafting skill or medicine check.

56:46 Gary the DM:  Okay. Yeah, we could do a medicine check.

56:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm flexible. I'm just throwing out ideas.

56:51 Gary the DM:  Yeah, no, I think, I think either one can work.

56:56 Gary the DM:  So roll your, your medicine skill your trained or not in it.

57:03 Gary the DM:  And you have a, you have a kit.

57:07 Gary the DM:  Okay. So, so yeah, you, you kind of go into your, your kit and mix a couple things and kind

57:16 Gary the DM:  of, you know, make a aloe kind of like soothing salve for burns.

57:21 Gary the DM:  You have to do it pretty quickly, but it should provide some relief for, for low end burns.

57:27 Gary the DM:  Even someone like Littlefinger might be able to use it to heal some burns that he may have incurred from

57:32 Gary the DM:  his, from his. The explosion that blasted his chest from the firework.

57:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And with my last action, can I toss the burn cream to Ginko and tell them?

57:44 Vic as Littlefinger:  Sure.

57:46 Gary the DM:  Yep. So you call out to Ginkgo and toss this cream to him.

57:54 Gary the DM:  We won't roll to see if you catch it.

57:55 Gary the DM:  That's, that's cool. I rolled some additional fires.

58:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, I'm glad I stayed one square back.

58:16 Gary the DM:  Those fires are growing. They're not growing as rapidly as they did earlier.

58:21 Gary the DM:  It seems like, you know, it's more of a natural increase.

58:24 Gary the DM:  But there's several things on fire and there's, you know, paper and other things.

58:28 Gary the DM:  And you guys can see there's still other, you know, boxes and things of fireworks and explosions.

58:34 Gary the DM:  Know, things that would go off here and every once in a while some fire.

58:37 Gary the DM:  Firecrackers kind of pop off and.

58:40 Gary the DM:  And mutter some of the. The staccato kind of pop up thing.

58:46 Gary the DM:  But we are at. Little finger.

58:48 Gary the DM:  You're next.

58:51 Vic as Littlefinger:  Okay, so I'm gonna pull that kid through.

58:56 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I want to get boxes moved out of the way, get him on the other side.

59:01 Vic as Littlefinger:  He's a little guy like the rest of us.

59:03 Vic as Littlefinger:  So let's move some boxes out of the way and pull him over with me.

59:07 Gary the DM:  Okay, cool.

59:08 Vic as Littlefinger:  Is that one action or two we'll take?

59:11 Gary the DM:  We'll say it's two actions. One to kind of pull, make some more room, pull up some room, and then

59:16 Gary the DM:  pull them across. That sounds right.

59:19 Gary the DM:  Give me an athletics check

59:24 Gary the DM:  and you have a plus one.

59:25 Gary the DM:  And you need a 13.

59:28 Vic as Littlefinger:  I would like to go ahead and apply the guidance that my friend Ginkgo provided for me.

59:32 Gary the DM:  Okay.

59:38 Gary the DM:  Oh, no. All right, so you start pulling.

59:42 Gary the DM:  I am.

59:44 Vic as Littlefinger:  Does halfling luck come into here ever? Can I.

59:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  Can I pull halfling luck out of my.

59:48 Vic as Littlefinger:  And get a. I read something about that.

59:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  Pull it out of what?

59:53 Chris as Boon:  Vic?

59:54 Vic as Littlefinger:  That got weird. So I stopped.

59:59 Vic as Littlefinger:  In my ancestry, there's halfling luck and it's a trigger.

60:04 Vic as Littlefinger:  If I fail a skill check or a saving throw, I can reroll the check once a day.

60:10 Gary the DM:  Yeah, they can definitely do that.

60:12 Gary the DM:  This would be your once a day, but you could definitely reroll this.

60:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  It's pretty early in the day, but I need to save this kid.

60:17 Vic as Littlefinger:  That fire is about to catch us, and so I.

60:23 Chris as Boon:  So let's.

60:23 Vic as Littlefinger:  Let's do it.

60:25 Chris as Boon:  All right.

60:28 Vic as Littlefinger:  Another athletics check coming up. And I don't get the plus one anymore, Right?

60:32 Gary the DM:  You get to re roll it.

60:33 Gary the DM:  So essentially, yes.

60:35 Vic as Littlefinger:  This is like your kind benevolent.

60:39 Vic as Littlefinger:  I like it.

60:42 Braedon as Da Baishan:  For now. The other Gary cup, eventually.

60:45 Chris as Boon:  No way.

60:46 Gary the DM:  But you roll the five again.

60:50 Gary the DM:  Oh, hold on.

60:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You need to reload your. Hit your roll 20, man.

60:56 Gary the DM:  Yeah, sometimes it does get stuck on things.

60:59 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

61:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  For just a second I was like.

61:01 Gary the DM:  Maybe I rolled the wrong one.

61:02 Vic as Littlefinger:  Nope, that looks like I rolled the 20 sided one every time.

61:06 Gary the DM:  So you pull and you can hear as you slide some boxes around, you start pulling through.

61:13 Gary the DM:  He's kind of like got his, you know, waist kind of through.

61:16 Gary the DM:  He got his Arms. And it seems like it's gonna happen.

61:18 Gary the DM:  And you hear some cracking sound.

61:20 Gary the DM:  And a couple of the boxes from a shelf above kind of hit the shelf above, and it seems like

61:28 Gary the DM:  that's gonna hold it for a second.

61:30 Gary the DM:  You're kind of like a halfling.

61:31 Gary the DM:  Luck, I think, saved him. And then it cracks and falls on him.

61:37 Gary the DM:  He takes some damage on me or the kid? The kid.

61:41 Gary the DM:  As he's pulled in between there.

61:44 Gary the DM:  If you. I'll do this. You have one more action, right?

61:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's right.

61:51 Gary the DM:  If you want to take the damage to save the kid, you can jump in there and kind of brace

61:56 Gary the DM:  it over him as your last action.

62:01 Vic as Littlefinger:  So clarifying question on positioning. If I do that, will I block Ginkgo's ability to get in and help us?

62:09 Vic as Littlefinger:  Like, will Ginkgo be able to get to the kid if I'm blocking that in that way?

62:14 Gary the DM:  Yes. Yes. Essentially, you jump in there and you're on all fours, holding the weight on your back as he

62:21 Gary the DM:  can pull him underneath you. That's what I want to do.

62:32 Gary the DM:  All right. You take three points of damage

62:38 Gary the DM:  happen left my ass.

62:45 Gary the DM:  So you're groaning. You guys see Littlefinger jump in the way of this falling couple shells.

62:55 Gary the DM:  It kind of crashes down on him.

62:57 Gary the DM:  He's, you know, grunting, holding it up as, you know, trying to say, pull them out.

63:03 Gary the DM:  But the kid is safe underneath Littlefinger, I guess.

63:08 Gary the DM:  Ginko, you're next.

63:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm going to come a bit closer and pull the kid out.

63:20 Chris as Boon:  All right.

63:22 Gary the DM:  You were able to pull him out.

63:28 Gary the DM:  Okay, well, we'll do.

63:32 Gary the DM:  But I guess we should do athletics or.

63:35 Gary the DM:  Yeah, athletics. Check there. You need a 10.

63:43 Gary the DM:  It's about to be indignant, and I.

63:45 Vic as Littlefinger:  Remembered it took me two rolls to get to 10.

63:49 Gary the DM:  So Krill comes in there with his early thorny arms that he has and pulls through the kid.

63:58 Gary the DM:  He grabs onto you. He's probably maybe 12, 13, something like that.

64:03 Gary the DM:  You know, a younger kid. He's not, you know, a teenager or young adult.

64:08 Gary the DM:  He's younger than that. And he is, like, embraces you and in, like, almost a chokehold initially.

64:16 Gary the DM:  He just latches on you very, very tightly as you kind of pull him out and step away on the

64:23 Gary the DM:  other side. Let's see, we got.

64:25 Gary the DM:  You're gonna be there and that he is now over here with you.

64:30 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right, cool. I'm gonna apply the salve that Baishan prepared for us.

64:37 Gary the DM:  Okay.

64:38 Oded as Ginkgo:  First I'm gonna. I'm gonna take it.

64:39 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm gonna do, like. And then I'm gonna apply it.

64:42 Gary the DM:  Just check it' okay.

64:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It may not be edible, though.

64:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  That's okay. I've had worse.

64:54 Gary the DM:  Tastes like lavender. I don't know what it tastes like.

64:59 Gary the DM:  So you apply some of the sapphire.

65:01 Gary the DM:  He's got, like, bruises on him.

65:04 Gary the DM:  It looks like powder burns as well.

65:08 Gary the DM:  And near his hands on his.

65:14 Gary the DM:  I'm. So you play it there.

65:16 Gary the DM:  He is initially kind of frantic, kind of shooting her hand away and then kind of wait as the staff.

65:26 Gary the DM:  He kind of calms him down a little bit.

65:27 Gary the DM:  But then he looks at you and says, we need to get out of here.

65:33 Gary the DM:  I'm sorry.

65:34 Chris as Boon:  I'm sorry.

65:34 Gary the DM:  We need to get out of here.

65:35 Gary the DM:  It wasn't my fault. It wasn't my fault.

65:38 Gary the DM:  He is muttering different things as you're pouring.

65:42 Gary the DM:  Putting that. Rubbing that salve on him.

65:44 Gary the DM:  Boone, you're up.

65:48 Chris as Boon:  Okay, I. I'm pretty close to the girl, so I'm gonna yell to the girl, like, hey, we're rescuing you.

65:56 Chris as Boon:  Come on. And I am actually gonna.

66:00 Chris as Boon:  Just gathering my forged dwarf, you know, ancestry, bravery or whatever.

66:04 Chris as Boon:  I'm gonna just dive through the fire.

66:07 Gary the DM:  Okay.

66:08 Chris as Boon:  To get toward her here.

66:13 Chris as Boon:  15ft, but I am going through the fire.

66:15 Chris as Boon:  Do I need to, like, roll anything or do I just have some damage?

66:18 Gary the DM:  Give me. How about

66:23 Gary the DM:  acrobatics check as you're gonna die through the fire?

66:27 Chris as Boon:  Sure.

66:30 Chris as Boon:  21.

66:32 Gary the DM:  All right. So you leaped through the fire other than it felt hot.

66:38 Gary the DM:  You take zero damage roll in front of this young child.

66:48 Gary the DM:  She is probably again, 12, 10 years old somewhere in there.

66:53 Gary the DM:  Young girl. She looks up, you can see, you know, tears in her eyes as they streaked out of the

66:59 Gary the DM:  dark soot that's on there. She has some light burns on her hands as well.

67:03 Gary the DM:  Some of her looks like her, you know, shirt.

67:06 Gary the DM:  May is tattered a bit and burned and singed.

67:10 Gary the DM:  She looks at you. She coughs a little bit, and you can see, like, tears kind of well up in

67:15 Gary the DM:  her eyes. And she just kind of reaches out her hands to, like, you know, carry me or help me.

67:21 Chris as Boon:  All right, that's. And I'm looking.

67:25 Chris as Boon:  Is there. Is there any more that can be revealed down here? Is there like a window or a door

67:30 Chris as Boon:  so I don't have to run all the way back across the building?

67:41 Gary the DM:  So there is these windows here on the south side.

67:46 Gary the DM:  That's that.

67:50 Chris as Boon:  Okay. I'm going to. I'm going to scoop her up and trying to catch the brunt of whatever with my

67:56 Chris as Boon:  own body. Just dive through the window with her.

67:59 Chris as Boon:  All right.

67:59 Gary the DM:  You smash your way through the window.

68:01 Gary the DM:  All right, we'll say that that's successful.

68:05 Gary the DM:  You have enough movement to smash your way through.

68:08 Gary the DM:  Actually, technically they would do like hardos damage.

68:14 Chris as Boon:  Do.

68:14 Gary the DM:  Do this roll your. That'd be goofy.

68:19 Gary the DM:  We'll. We'll say you get through.

68:25 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

68:27 Gary the DM:  You took two points of damage from smashing through the window.

68:31 Chris as Boon:  Got it.

68:32 Gary the DM:  So you kind of like with your back, you know, through the window, kind of pull your way through.

68:38 Gary the DM:  She's in front of you. Come to the other side.

68:42 Gary the DM:  Smoke is now pouring out of that window.

68:44 Gary the DM:  As you can see, the crowd of several people on, you know, the.

68:48 Gary the DM:  That side are like putting out the fire on.

68:51 Gary the DM:  On the side of the. Of.

68:54 Gary the DM:  Of the warehouse.

68:58 Gary the DM:  The. Another lady runs up and scoops up Kimmy is what she calls the girl.

69:08 Gary the DM:  And you know, she reaches. Sees the.

69:11 Gary the DM:  This lady that come up and scoop her up after you pull her out and she's like mom.

69:16 Gary the DM:  And she just pulls her away.

69:19 Gary the DM:  And they start crying and huddle together as they.

69:23 Gary the DM:  She kind of journeys away from the fire.

69:26 Gary the DM:  People still are trying to put out the fire in the.

69:29 Gary the DM:  In the building as this side is starting to.

69:32 Gary the DM:  They're starting to make headway against it.

69:35 Gary the DM:  We got. Bashan is next.

69:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I can. I can see that they got the little boy, but I can't.

69:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I probably can't see what happened to the little girl on Boone.

69:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right.

69:46 Gary the DM:  Right. Yeah.

69:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

69:49 Gary the DM:  Someone call you probably you heard a window smash?

69:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Fairly sharp as a detective.

69:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'll assume that they got out.

70:00 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'll. I'll call out to Ginkgo and Littlefinger and tell him to come back this way.

70:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It's still clear. And I'll ask him to describe the.

70:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The burns on the boy while they're on the way.

70:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And I'm gonna use. I think I get a free action for extreme bs.

70:24 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

70:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Infection.

70:26 Gary the DM:  Okay.

70:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  See what I learned from their burn patterns on their hands.

70:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Powder burns.

70:31 Gary the DM:  Okay. Give me, I guess a medicine check.

70:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Seventeen.

70:39 Gary the DM:  Seventeen. Okay. So as you. You hear description, you see some, you know, that are still there in the location.

70:50 Gary the DM:  So there's a couple of things.

70:53 Gary the DM:  This and you actually being inside probably you would picked up on a slight smell as well, like a little

70:59 Gary the DM:  kerosene that seems a little bit more definitely stronger than it should be here.

71:05 Gary the DM:  And may have been using an accelerant.

71:08 Gary the DM:  The boy has some kerosene smell to his clothing that you notice as he got close to you by Sean.

71:16 Gary the DM:  And it looks like he was close to the initial explosion.

71:22 Gary the DM:  The way it like the burn patterns in the.

71:27 Gary the DM:  Are on his hands and up his side of his face and neck.

71:31 Gary the DM:  It probably went off as he Was very close to it and his hands may have been out toward it.

71:43 Gary the DM:  I guess we'll do Little Finger.

71:44 Gary the DM:  I guess I just need an athletics check for you to get out of the crushing

71:53 Gary the DM:  shelves and you need a 12.

71:57 Gary the DM:  Otherwise you'll have to ask for help.

72:06 Gary the DM:  All right, so you were able to.

72:09 Gary the DM:  You push against the. The weight, give yourself a little bit of clearance as you are able to roll your

72:14 Gary the DM:  way out. And it collapses down behind you.

72:17 Gary the DM:  As you guys are now,

72:27 Gary the DM:  As you guys are over here, as well as Little Finger now, as you guys are making your way to

72:34 Gary the DM:  the. The door to the north, people kind of coming in.

72:40 Gary the DM:  You hear buckets of water kind of swishing in as folks come in, are starting to put out the fires.

72:46 Gary the DM:  You guys get the. The boy out on the north side and Boone, you start walking around and.

72:54 Gary the DM:  And meet up with the rest of the party on the north side.

72:56 Gary the DM:  As the boy is there.

73:01 Gary the DM:  As he comes out on the north, someone rushes up to him.

73:09 Gary the DM:  What were you doing in there? And it's a familiar voice.

73:12 Gary the DM:  It's Yang. So this happens to be a young boy, Kitsune, who is Hong Yong's son.

73:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  He was mad. He didn't get any shuriken and so.

73:25 Chris as Boon:  He set up on her.

73:30 Gary the DM:  He pulls as you pull him out and you know, he scolds his son a little bit like what are

73:35 Gary the DM:  you doing in there? And yeah.

73:39 Gary the DM:  Voices. He. It wasn't me. He goes, I don't know what happened.

73:42 Gary the DM:  We wanted to look at the fireworks.

73:43 Gary the DM:  That's all like. Like I didn't do anything else.

73:47 Gary the DM:  And the rest of the, you know, know, kind of like the town.

73:52 Gary the DM:  Several of the town people are helping and eventually, you know, the, the building is smoldering as the fire is

73:57 Gary the DM:  a lot lot less. And they, you know, take.

74:00 Gary the DM:  Take care of it. You can see the ominous kind of like boom foots of a heavy walk as the

74:10 Gary the DM:  magistrate Kurasawa is walking in this direction.

74:14 Gary the DM:  Um, Yang. So says I. He goes, I don't want to get in trouble because I don't want my.

74:21 Gary the DM:  My son to get in trouble either.

74:23 Gary the DM:  If we'll. I'll take him back to the forge if, if you guys don't mind.

74:30 Gary the DM:  And I'll refund any of the.

74:32 Gary the DM:  Of the. The money that you guys have paid for any.

74:34 Gary the DM:  All of your orders that you made today.

74:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I will uh. There's apparently a thing where I could say start an investigation and I have to title

74:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  it. So it is the. The investigation of the children's fire.

74:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And I will. I'll spend a minute.

74:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  What do they call it pursuing a lead.

74:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'll use what I know about the burn patterns on their hand, the smell of kerosene, the fact that

75:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  he said he was just trying to look at the fire fireworks.

75:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Go ahead.

75:11 Gary the DM:  Okay. I think so. Yeah. That you have a complicated one.

75:20 Gary the DM:  I have to keep looking at that a bit.

75:22 Gary the DM:  So. Yeah. So when there's definitely a lead I guess give me a.

75:36 Gary the DM:  Trying to think what skill it would be.

75:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It says a lot about perception checks in here.

75:48 Gary the DM:  Yeah, that's the first one that that.

75:51 Gary the DM:  So we'll do a perception check as.

75:54 Gary the DM:  So give me a perception check.

75:57 Gary the DM:  The rest of the party's there and this the magistrate.

76:01 Gary the DM:  It's getting closer. He does not look exceedingly happy.

76:04 Gary the DM:  Although it's hard to tell. He doesn't tend to smile a lot.

76:10 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm gonna give you guidance.

76:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay, I'll use that. And I also get a plus one circumstance bonus to any perception checks while pursuing an

76:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  investigation.

76:20 Gary the DM:  Okay. So you got a 15 basically yeah.

76:25 Gary the DM:  So.

76:29 Gary the DM:  So as you like I said had a chance to quickly assess the.

76:34 Gary the DM:  The rate of the fire. The.

76:38 Gary the DM:  The young kid is the girl.

76:42 Gary the DM:  But you didn't. You didn't interact with her at all.

76:44 Gary the DM:  But, but how is the is Yong son.

76:53 Gary the DM:  The. I guess the. The lead feels like this was not a natural causes fire.

77:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Kids don't usually play around with kerosene.

77:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right. Like that. Doesn't he?

77:07 Gary the DM:  It definitely was accelerated by kerosene.

77:10 Gary the DM:  And

77:14 Gary the DM:  from the. From the burn patterns it looks like the.

77:17 Gary the DM:  The young boy probably started the initial fire.

77:20 Chris as Boon:  Yep.

77:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. My. I think my supposition here is someone sabotaged the fireworks.

77:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They were intending to start this fire and the kids were you know being a little mischievous going look at

77:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  the fireworks and accidentally started it prematurely and got caught in it.

77:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  Pretty generous reading of the evidence Officer.

77:42 Gary the DM:  You. I guess that could be your supposition.

77:45 Gary the DM:  I guess if you had a chance to talk to how or kidney you could maybe you know get some

77:52 Gary the DM:  better details about what they did and what happened while they're in there.

77:56 Gary the DM:  But right now that might be your best lead or your only lead so far.

78:02 Gary the DM:  They get more information. Kurosawa comes up and folks comic Nick Room and he looks at.

78:10 Gary the DM:  Assesses the situation and looks at in this case the group Boone and Ginkgo and

78:22 Gary the DM:  Littlefinger. And he.

78:29 Gary the DM:  This is most unfortunate. He looks at the building and the fire and a dark omen and one we should

78:42 Gary the DM:  address very critically. I think I have a lot of folks here in town have a purpose and a job

78:52 Gary the DM:  responsibility. You or I think are free And I think we'd be ideal

79:02 Gary the DM:  for this task that I have for you.

79:05 Gary the DM:  You'll be in service of the mayor in doing this so very honorable position.

79:13 Gary the DM:  Please, let's come to my estate and we can talk about what I've asked of you.

79:23 Vic as Littlefinger:  The magistrate has just asked us to come hang out at his place.

79:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  He hasn't told us why or what he wants us to do or anything like that.

79:30 Gary the DM:  He's going to give you a job, but once it wants to tell you what it is.

79:35 Chris as Boon:  And he's an himself, right? Yes.

79:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I distrust him.

79:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But I'm willing to play along if it gets us more clues.

79:46 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah, exactly. Ginko is all in.

79:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  I want to know everything I.

79:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  I can find out.

79:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  So the blacksmith and his kid beat it.

79:57 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Yeah. He. He didn't. He didn't want his kid to get in trouble, and so he took him to

80:03 Gary the DM:  the forge, basically.

80:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  And the magistrate's not asking any questions about how the fire got started or anything like that.

80:11 Vic as Littlefinger:  He's just like, you guys need a job.

80:12 Vic as Littlefinger:  Let's go. He's. He's feeling pretty good about everything so far.

80:15 Gary the DM:  Yep.

80:17 Vic as Littlefinger:  You guys. You guys think it's cool with this guy?

80:21 Gary the DM:  And the bucket brigade's got the fire essentially.

80:24 Gary the DM:  Like it's smoldering.

80:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm similarly suspicious as Littlefinger is.

80:30 Gary the DM:  I'm like, this is the guy with.

80:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  The giant katana on his back.

80:34 Gary the DM:  That is huge.

80:35 Vic as Littlefinger:  Super tall. Us three little dudes in that one Orc.

80:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  You guys are like, cool.

80:39 Gary the DM:  Let's.

80:40 Vic as Littlefinger:  Let's go to this place. I'm in.

80:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm in for sure. I'm. I would like.

80:45 Vic as Littlefinger:  It's like, when would be an appropriate time for me to like.

80:48 Vic as Littlefinger:  I wouldn't mind some of that sav.

80:50 Vic as Littlefinger:  I got like burned a bunch in there.

80:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm down a few hit points.

80:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  I would mind with some. Some sab that they.

80:55 Vic as Littlefinger:  They made when that. That my man died by Sean made.

80:58 Vic as Littlefinger:  Would that help me before we start? Can I do that while we're walking behind?

81:01 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

81:02 Vic as Littlefinger:  The magistrate or something of that effect.

81:04 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can do that.

81:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  Cool, cool, cool. I'm in.

81:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let's.

81:07 Gary the DM:  Let's roll.

81:08 Vic as Littlefinger:  Boone, any. Any wise words to stop us before we go?

81:13 Chris as Boon:  I got nowhere better to be.

81:14 Chris as Boon:  Let's. Let's roll.

81:16 Gary the DM:  So you guys walk to the.

81:18 Gary the DM:  This estate as Littlefinger applies a SAP to some of his burns that he.

81:22 Gary the DM:  That he occurred. You get two hippoids back.

81:25 Gary the DM:  Little finger as the. The sav.

81:28 Gary the DM:  You know, is cooling the. You know, stops the ache and fiery pain from some of the Burns that you

81:36 Gary the DM:  have. You guys get to this estate.

81:38 Gary the DM:  And the estate is, you know, a little walled complex.

81:42 Gary the DM:  As you walk through, like, an opening gate, there's like a garden and, you know, koi pond or whatever might

81:47 Gary the DM:  be in there. A few bread, you know, like Mr.

81:49 Gary the DM:  Miyagi's kind of garden that he had in Ky.

81:54 Chris as Boon:  Kid.

81:55 Gary the DM:  He sits down at essentially a small table there, more like where you kneel down.

82:01 Gary the DM:  And he kneels down with that, and it pours some water out for everybody.

82:06 Chris as Boon:  He says.

82:12 Gary the DM:  I'm sure you're nervous and skeptical.

82:18 Gary the DM:  My presence tends to do that in many times in an unwanted way.

82:27 Gary the DM:  You need this exchange to go over very well.

82:33 Gary the DM:  I know that there are certain actions within the town that are not as amenable to the change of power

82:44 Gary the DM:  as others. I need some deputies, some eyes on the ground, some folks who will.

82:53 Gary the DM:  That I can hold accountable that this will go off smoothly.

82:59 Gary the DM:  I think I found my committee.

83:04 Gary the DM:  I am tasking you for with making sure that the thermody goes off as prescribed.

83:16 Gary the DM:  There will be no more incidents.

83:19 Gary the DM:  I am not a fool. This explosion the day before our arrival is highly suspect.

83:30 Gary the DM:  I think I found an investigator as he nods in Baishan's direction to find out what exactly happened here and

83:40 Gary the DM:  make sure that with the help of these three deputies, Lord Baishan, that nothing else happens to jeopardize the mayor's

83:53 Gary the DM:  arrival. The word bring you great honor.

84:01 Gary the DM:  If you achieve this, I will remember this in future dealings with you for.

84:14 Gary the DM:  And the mayor will hear of it as well.

84:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So we four are new to town.

84:23 Gary the DM:  I wouldn't say new to town.

84:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  Not me.

84:28 Gary the DM:  We have. We have one who has ties to the city.

84:32 Gary the DM:  We have a skilled investigator. And in fact, I think your unique relationships with the town and not being as

84:42 Gary the DM:  entrenched gives me actually

84:48 Gary the DM:  more. I'm more willing to support you in this and that.

84:51 Gary the DM:  I think it'll be a less biased account of what's going on.

84:58 Vic as Littlefinger:  What. What do you think about me using my diplomacy skill to ask for money?

85:07 Gary the DM:  You're asking him. You're. Are you as Vic the player.

85:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

85:12 Vic as Littlefinger:  I would like to whisper to my teammates here in front of, like, we're like.

85:16 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're all probably, like, die by.

85:18 Vic as Littlefinger:  Sean's probably standing in front. And that's the dwarf.

85:21 Vic as Littlefinger:  And to have the. The dwarf and the mushroom and the other.

85:24 Vic as Littlefinger:  Actually, I guess I'm the only half.

85:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  It's a halfling of mushroom and a dwarf.

85:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right.

85:30 Gary the DM:  I threw a bar.

85:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

85:34 Vic as Littlefinger:  I was like, hey, guys, like, we're getting paid, right?

85:37 Gary the DM:  Like, you guys are actually at a table like imagine a small like tea table or kneeling like out in

85:45 Gary the DM:  the garden.

85:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  You know. And my most diplomac capabilities possible and the most use of my charisma I would like to add.

86:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  Hey, this is going to be expensive.

86:01 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're going to need supplies. We may even need to hire some mercenaries to help help us.

86:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  What type of funds will we have to accomplish this goal for you to make sure this festival goes off

86:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  without a hitch.

86:13 Gary the DM:  I guess. Give me a diplomacy check.

86:23 Gary the DM:  14 is pretty good. Curious how it glares in your direction.

86:30 Vic as Littlefinger:  I avert my gaze.

86:38 Gary the DM:  Little man.

86:44 Gary the DM:  I believe this reward upon successful completion which I fully expect in favor from the ruling class is much more

86:58 Gary the DM:  reward than any shiny coin can give you.

87:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I will say a favor from a ruling class.

87:10 Gary the DM:  The ruling class.

87:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And how do you expect us to be accountable for the actions of the entire town that you are supposed

87:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  to be governor?

87:33 Chris as Boon:  Well.

87:35 Gary the DM:  I could take a very firm fisted stance here.

87:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Isn't that the way of the omi?

87:48 Gary the DM:  That's a. It's very much rumors.

87:53 Gary the DM:  We have lots of ways of achieving success.

87:58 Gary the DM:  Our physical might is one way.

88:00 Gary the DM:  We also have diplomacy. We wouldn't be where we are today without being able to assess situations.

88:12 Gary the DM:  This transfer needs to. Needs to happen successfully.

88:21 Gary the DM:  The more that there's strife, the longer it'll take to achieve our goals here.

88:29 Gary the DM:  And if we have to bring in more reinforcements, more hands to help, we can.

88:41 Gary the DM:  But it'll be a much less pleasant and a much less freedom filled way for Willowshore here.

88:52 Gary the DM:  I was hoping to avoid that by selecting a group of folks who have different combination of skills and do

89:01 Gary the DM:  not represent directly the ruling power or have my

89:10 Gary the DM:  ire of apprehension when folks see me when I come into a room.

89:16 Gary the DM:  Conversations change greatly when you enter a room.

89:21 Gary the DM:  My guess is they don't alter all that much.

89:24 Gary the DM:  I believe you can be more persuasive than I could.

89:30 Gary the DM:  I could make people do things.

89:33 Gary the DM:  That's not what I want to do here.

89:37 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Can I sense motive against him and see if he's being honest with him on his mo.

89:42 Braedon as Da Baishan:  With us on his motive?

89:44 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Yeah. Is there. I think there's a sense motive.

89:48 Gary the DM:  I think there's. What do they call it?

89:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I've got a sense motive action.

89:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It says you have to roll a secret perception check.

89:58 Gary the DM:  Oh, it's perception again.

89:59 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

90:03 Gary the DM:  Yeah. I think it's. It's an opposed role.

90:06 Gary the DM:  So go ahead.

90:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, it. It is. And I get a.

90:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I get a plus one to that.

90:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Not great.

90:18 Gary the DM:  From your.

90:22 Gary the DM:  You can't really read anything other than I Guess which.

90:27 Gary the DM:  Everybody could. Extreme confidence.

90:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

90:34 Gary the DM:  Any overconfidence even. He seems to fear nothing on.

90:39 Gary the DM:  On this at all. Is he lying or not? You're not sure? Doesn't.

90:42 Gary the DM:  He's a firm believer, I guess, if he is.

90:45 Gary the DM:  But you didn't really pick up any type of nuanced deception or anything under the.

90:52 Gary the DM:  Anything, you know, any other readings into it other than.

90:56 Gary the DM:  Than he firmly believes like, that they could come in and essentially stronger if they wanted to.

91:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

91:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  With the party before we.

91:17 Chris as Boon:  How far away are we from the mayor taking over? Is this like a week or something?

91:21 Gary the DM:  No, it's gonna be the next.

91:23 Gary the DM:  Next evening.

91:25 Chris as Boon:  Oh, okay.

91:27 Gary the DM:  So there's. So this is the morning before supposedly the next evening the mayor is supposed to arrive.

91:34 Gary the DM:  He wants to make sure that.

91:35 Gary the DM:  That happen,

91:45 Gary the DM:  Like everybody's there. There won't be any other issues that happen, and it happens smoothly for the mayor when he

91:51 Gary the DM:  comes in. So it's not a week away.

91:52 Gary the DM:  It's only essentially the day away, day and a half away.

91:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let us confer before we sign on to your crusade.

92:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  A moment, please.

92:10 Gary the DM:  He looks at you for a second and then nods.

92:17 Gary the DM:  Very well. I'll give you 60 seconds.

92:21 Gary the DM:  He steps up, walks away, and he starts tending the toy pond that he had nearby.

92:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They'll turn to y' all and be like, okay, what's the doing want to do here?

92:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  I. I think we. We. We want to say yes, because if we find any dissidents or anyone that is

92:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  opposed to the new merit, you know, coming on, they are our allies.

92:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  We want to find them.

92:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm good with that, but like Littlefinger said, I'm wary of being held accountable for the actions of the rest

92:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  of the town and of those dissidents.

93:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yes, that is a. A challenge.

93:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  But maybe we can figure it out when we get there.

93:13 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

93:16 Gary the DM:  I mean, I think at this point.

93:18 Vic as Littlefinger:  If we don't say yes, something worse might happen.

93:20 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

93:21 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

93:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That his physical might ain't that much.

93:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  Right. My little legs are fast, so.

93:32 Chris as Boon:  You'Re out of luck for the day.

93:35 Vic as Littlefinger:  Exactly.

93:36 Gary the DM:  Yeah, exactly.

93:37 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah, no doubt. So I, you know, I think we proceed, but we just proceed with caution.

93:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  I. I like. I like the idea of finding allies, but we have to be careful to not be caught

93:53 Vic as Littlefinger:  in that.

93:57 Vic as Littlefinger:  So you know what? We agree, and then we're off back in town searching around.

94:01 Vic as Littlefinger:  I assume so. Yeah. I think we should agree, and then, you know, we got to get out of this

94:05 Vic as Littlefinger:  room. So we have to agree to get out of this room.

94:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Okay.

94:10 Gary the DM:  You guys are outside, but yeah, one.

94:12 Chris as Boon:  Thought while we're chatting secretly, you know, his whole thing like, oh, you know, you'll have a good reputation or

94:18 Chris as Boon:  something. That's great. I've worked. I've been a mercenary for.

94:21 Chris as Boon:  For decades now. I mean, come on, like, he's got money.

94:24 Chris as Boon:  Let's. Let's. If we're in, let's ask whoever's good at that kind of thing.

94:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I've got pretty good diplomacy. I think it's worth a shot.

94:34 Oded as Ginkgo:  It's. It's also possible that he is setting us up to be the scapegoats.

94:39 Vic as Littlefinger:  100.

94:40 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yep, that's exactly.

94:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're gonna have to do the old switcheroo, rip the mask off and it was Mr.

94:45 Vic as Littlefinger:  Burns the whole time type situation here.

94:47 Chris as Boon:  Good thinking.

94:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah. But in any case, like, we don't have a choice.

94:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  Like, this is. This is the way forward, no matter what.

94:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I agree.

94:57 Gary the DM:  He comes back after, you know, say a minute or so, whatever, and strides back down at the table and

95:06 Gary the DM:  he says, what is your decision?

95:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think. I think we can do as you ask.

95:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  However, it is a large challenge even for the four of us or five of us when Donkey feels better.

95:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  This is. This is going to be a challenge for us as we are not well equipped for this job

95:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  and we're quite broke. So we.

95:35 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We would need some funds to be able to make your dream become a real reality.

95:40 Gary the DM:  Okay, I guess. Give me a.

95:46 Gary the DM:  A diplomacy check and you get a plus two.

95:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  One maybe.

95:55 Vic as Littlefinger:  Plus two.

95:55 Gary the DM:  18. Okay, 20. All right. So.

96:00 Gary the DM:  He looks at the group again and this is fine.

96:08 Gary the DM:  Your. Your strange appeal to this power that these trinkets carry is amusing to me.

96:21 Gary the DM:  What is your price?

96:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think a good starting rate before the mayor arrives, probably 100 gold pieces.

96:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  Each.

96:37 Vic as Littlefinger:  Less expensive.

96:47 Gary the DM:  Plus dentals and stuff like that.

96:50 Gary the DM:  He looks stares for a second and then this bellowing laugh erupts from him head like tilts for this guy.

97:01 Gary the DM:  100 gold pieces each. Like, seriously, what is the price?

97:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Excuse my. My overzealous compatriot here.

97:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think 100 gold pieces for the group of us and a assurance that, shall we need any backup, you

97:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  won't be too far away.

97:32 Gary the DM:  And I take it,

97:38 Gary the DM:  I agree on 50 gold pieces now.

97:42 Gary the DM:  And after a successful exchange, the secondary.

97:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think that's reasonable.

97:51 Gary the DM:  He. It goes in a pouch.

97:54 Gary the DM:  Count some coins. He gives this leather, you know, pouch satchel thing and puts it on the center of the

98:02 Gary the DM:  table. Let's go of it. Of course, the price will be very, very high if things don't go smoothly.

98:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like more than 50 gold pieces high.

98:24 Gary the DM:  Be careful what you wish for.

98:30 Chris as Boon:  This is a mental conversation you two are having, I assume, you know, little fingers.

98:34 Chris as Boon:  Little fingers are just twitching. You're just looking at him.

98:39 Gary the DM:  So he stands up, says, tomorrow evening is the fulfillment of the transfer of power, the right of the passion,

98:53 Gary the DM:  the passage. And when the mayor will arrive, I venturing out to greet and making sure the path of his

99:01 Gary the DM:  journey is clear. I expect all of the things in the town to be resolved.

99:12 Gary the DM:  We will meet afterward for final payment.

99:17 Gary the DM:  And he stands up and bows.

99:21 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can we. Can we ask for, like, do you have any leads, any suspicion, anything you can.

99:29 Oded as Ginkgo:  Any information you can share with us?

99:33 Gary the DM:  I have the obvious one that he show family,

99:45 Gary the DM:  The former ruling family here has the most to lose.

99:53 Gary the DM:  If I was an investigator, supposedly you have one of some renown.

100:01 Gary the DM:  That's where I would look.

100:03 Chris as Boon:  Gisho family.

100:06 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I think I spelled it this way.

100:07 Gary the DM:  I was trying to. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it exactly right, but.

100:14 Gary the DM:  Like that.

100:15 Chris as Boon:  Ah, okay, okay.

100:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't know. I only speak Chinese.

100:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't speak Japanese.

100:21 Gary the DM:  I'm mixing it all up too.

100:28 Gary the DM:  I put it in Google Translate, and that's kind of what it told me to say.

100:31 Gary the DM:  So say it again. Ye.

100:36 Oded as Ginkgo:  Show.

100:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think that's probably.

100:40 Gary the DM:  It's like T, S, O, U.

100:41 Gary the DM:  Yeah. And tsou. Ye. So something like that, maybe.

100:47 Gary the DM:  So. Yeah.

100:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You gotta get the tones, Gary.

100:53 Chris as Boon:  All right.

100:53 Gary the DM:  Yeah, we'll get there.

100:59 Vic as Littlefinger:  So let's get away from this guy.

101:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You aren't gonna pick Pocket in?

101:06 Vic as Littlefinger:  No, because we gotta meet him again later, and I'm not sure that's gonna work out well just in case.

101:11 Vic as Littlefinger:  But I. I do want to make sure that I utilize the skill I have.

101:14 Chris as Boon:  I'm.

101:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm probably jumping the gun a little too soon.

101:17 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think I've worried Boone a little.

101:19 Vic as Littlefinger:  He's probably like, hey, settle down over there.

101:22 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I'll wait. I'll wait. But I do think we.

101:26 Vic as Littlefinger:  We get out of here and we head over to that.

101:28 Vic as Littlefinger:  If I remember right, the lodge, there's a lodge that the existing ruling family.

101:33 Vic as Littlefinger:  So maybe if we start heading that way.

101:35 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah. The Silver Mist Lodge is on the other side of the river, but still in town.

101:42 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

101:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. I think we walk out behind him and start heading that way.

101:50 Chris as Boon:  I was just curious about that weapon I had.

101:52 Chris as Boon:  I dropped it in the general chat.

101:53 Chris as Boon:  So it's like a long. Is that the long thing that he has the magistrate, or was it something different?

102:01 Chris as Boon:  I can't remember.

102:03 Gary the DM:  It's not that.

102:04 Chris as Boon:  Oh, okay.

102:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

102:06 Gary the DM:  It is a nodachi, no dachshi.

102:10 Chris as Boon:  All right.

102:12 Gary the DM:  It's close to that, though.

102:17 Vic as Littlefinger:  Those prices don't take into account inflation either, so don't get excited.

102:22 Chris as Boon:  Oh, it's just a really long sword.

102:24 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

102:25 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

102:25 Chris as Boon:  Yeah. Chopping horses and stuff.

102:33 Oded as Ginkgo:  So.

102:33 Gary the DM:  See you guys. Head out. I said the town is starting to get back to work.

102:41 Gary the DM:  Like, the fishermen and others are back into their boats, and they're starting to get back to normal.

102:47 Gary the DM:  A lot of the. The rumors and other stuff in town are talking about the fire, and a lot of

102:53 Gary the DM:  folks are doing different types of charms and rituals, thinking that, oh, this is.

102:58 Gary the DM:  This is a bad omen. You know, this.

103:00 Gary the DM:  This means. You know, it could mean that the, you know, the river spirits are.

103:04 Gary the DM:  Are angered by the, you know, by the oni presence.

103:09 Gary the DM:  Now, that hasn't been here. Others believe, you know, other.

103:15 Gary the DM:  You know, spirits, other types of omens that.

103:17 Gary the DM:  That could be on. On there.

103:18 Oded as Ginkgo:  So.

103:20 Gary the DM:  But you guys are headed to the lodge.

103:26 Gary the DM:  The silver. Nice, dude.

103:30 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're all staying together.

103:33 Chris as Boon:  Right?

103:34 Gary the DM:  You can.

103:34 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Or.

103:34 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can split up if you want to.

103:36 Vic as Littlefinger:  Well, I need to go by the apothecary real quick, pick up some bandages and stuff and get something to

103:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  heal my burns and my wounds from our excursion in the burning building.

103:47 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm still down five health points, so before I go.

103:51 Oded as Ginkgo:  I got you. I got you.

103:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  No, no. No worries. Why didn't you say so?

103:58 Vic as Littlefinger:  No. Funny. You guys want to hook me up with some heels, I'm in, but otherwise, I need to before

104:03 Vic as Littlefinger:  I. Because there's potential for trouble at the end there, you know?

104:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

104:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Damage.

104:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  What?

104:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You guys took damage in that fire? What happened?

104:19 Vic as Littlefinger:  Just me. Just me. And I went running in.

104:22 Vic as Littlefinger:  Even though I didn't want to be there.

104:23 Gary the DM:  I ended up in front somehow, and.

104:25 Vic as Littlefinger:  Then was not very athletic. It was pretty lifelike.

104:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. Yeah, I'll. I'll cast a heal spell.

104:35 Gary the DM:  Okay.

104:37 Oded as Ginkgo:  So I just. I just. I click cast or I click the.

104:40 Oded as Ginkgo:  The dice to roll.

104:43 Gary the DM:  I think you click cast on it.

104:45 Gary the DM:  That takes it away from your rel.

104:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I click cast. And then what?

104:54 Gary the DM:  I'll click that one.

104:57 Oded as Ginkgo:  Here you go, my friend.

105:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Didn't we already give you two hit points back earlier?

105:10 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

105:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, okay, so you're still down 5.

105:14 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm only down 4 because benevolent mushroom Man.

105:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  I have a name.

105:30 Oded as Ginkgo:  How do I. How do I recover? Like, spell slots? How does that work?

105:37 Gary the DM:  It works similar to, like, D and D.

105:39 Gary the DM:  So after a long rest, you.

105:41 Gary the DM:  You get all them back? Yeah.

105:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, so we're gonna. We're gonna rest Anyway, so I can cast again.

105:46 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I think you, you have four of those.

105:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

105:51 Gary the DM:  Because you're, you're a healer. Oh, you meant.

105:54 Gary the DM:  You saw that in the chat.

105:55 Gary the DM:  But your, your deity. There's every deity that you pray to has an athemon.

106:01 Gary the DM:  Right. Something that you don't do.

106:02 Gary the DM:  There's edicts. And yours is you don't do damage like physical damage to anything, any living thing.

106:09 Gary the DM:  So is it.

106:10 Oded as Ginkgo:  Is it physical damage or lethal damage?

106:14 Chris as Boon:  It.

106:14 Gary the DM:  It is. You don't do any.

106:16 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I think I typed it in there.

106:20 Oded as Ginkgo:  I think you said lethal damage so.

106:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You can hurt him but not kill them.

106:26 Gary the DM:  So when I was reading on that, essentially this, this deity is a pacifist.

106:34 Gary the DM:  So any damage that is not subdual damage is lethal damage in, in the way the game works.

106:43 Gary the DM:  So it's not the killing blow.

106:46 Gary the DM:  It's that you're drawing blood and doing like lethal damage.

106:50 Gary the DM:  You have to only do subdual damage.

106:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  What, what's, what does that, what does that mean?

106:56 Gary the DM:  You. You only knock people out?

106:58 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah.

106:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I'm good with that.

107:01 Chris as Boon:  Phaser.

107:02 Gary the DM:  Unless they're non living and then you can go for it.

107:05 Gary the DM:  So if they're like undead or a construct or something like that, even that.

107:10 Gary the DM:  I don't know if that. I guess that'll be up to you.

107:12 Gary the DM:  Do. Are they a living soul that you don't want to hurt? Because they are animated in some way.

107:18 Gary the DM:  But anyway. Yeah, that's your.

107:20 Chris as Boon:  Okay, is there like damage math if you think tries to do that?

107:25 Gary the DM:  Yeah, so he, he does. He'll always be doing less damage than everybody else, basically.

107:32 Gary the DM:  Even some dual damage. Unless you use like there's a couple weapons.

107:36 Gary the DM:  Like I think a SAP is one of them because it's designed to knock people out.

107:40 Gary the DM:  That one does full damage. But you always do less damage because like if you pick up a sword, you're

107:44 Gary the DM:  going to have to just get people to slide a bit.

107:47 Gary the DM:  Right. Because you don't want to use the edge of it.

107:50 Gary the DM:  So you have to find weapons.

107:51 Gary the DM:  Blunt weapons will probably be even that does lethal damage.

107:55 Gary the DM:  So you, you basically think, yeah, for everything.

107:59 Gary the DM:  But like a SAP, I think you'll be doing less damage.

108:01 Gary the DM:  I think it's like minus two or something like that.

108:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, what about like a staff that does lethal damage?

108:08 Gary the DM:  Yeah, it does bruising damage.

108:10 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, okay, I'll. I'll figure it out, but I'm good with that.

108:14 Gary the DM:  Or you can grapple something. I guess you can just be.

108:19 Gary the DM:  Or not to death. I didn't say that.

108:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  Almost death. Near death.

108:28 Gary the DM:  Until they Fall asleep. You could pick another deity.

108:33 Gary the DM:  That would be the other way.

108:34 Gary the DM:  There's. There's lots of them in.

108:36 Gary the DM:  In the pantheon. So I think the one that you had before for Asma might still be a good one,

108:41 Gary the DM:  depending, because that has the cycle of life, I think you're.

108:44 Gary the DM:  They're going for. And so that one still could be avoided.

108:47 Gary the DM:  They don't have that enough amount.

108:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  It sounds like you're trying to dissuade me to not.

108:53 Gary the DM:  No, I just wasn't sure if you knew that or not.

108:56 Gary the DM:  So that was it.

108:57 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I'll. I'll think about it.

108:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  But that sounds interesting. Maybe.

109:01 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

109:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

109:05 Gary the DM:  All right, so you guys. Okay.

109:09 Gary the DM:  All right, so we'll go to about 10 and then we'll call it a night.

109:13 Chris as Boon:  Right?

109:13 Gary the DM:  That's not good because that's 11 o' clock, I think for.

109:16 Gary the DM:  All right, so you guys go across the bridge, right? You know, rivers there you can.

109:23 Gary the DM:  On the other side, there's several other buildings.

109:25 Gary the DM:  Part of the town, right. There's the.

109:29 Gary the DM:  There's the. The lodges on that side.

109:33 Gary the DM:  Few some homes and things like that as well.

109:36 Gary the DM:  Off to the further out from outside of town, you can start seeing like some of the like, pastures that

109:44 Gary the DM:  are out there and cattle that people use here fishing and there's a big industry in this area.

109:52 Gary the DM:  But to get to the. The Silver Mist Lodge, which is right on the shoreline.

109:58 Gary the DM:  So it was a very upscale establishment back in the heyday of Willow Shore.

110:04 Gary the DM:  Right now it's just. I would say it's dilapidated, but it's a, you know, a shadow of its former self.

110:11 Gary the DM:  Like all of the austere kind of while the carvings and.

110:17 Gary the DM:  And style are still there. They're kind of like, hey, could use a better paint job.

110:23 Gary the DM:  They're older now. It's been through a couple owners, I guess, but it's still has some nicer rooms and right

110:35 Gary the DM:  on the river. And so it's a place that people can stay.

110:41 Gary the DM:  And that's where you guys walk into the.

110:45 Gary the DM:  The main lobby area. And when you walk in the main lobby, there's, you know, basically a desk that's in

110:52 Gary the DM:  front of there and the stairs going up that you can immediately see.

110:55 Gary the DM:  To your right you can see a.

110:58 Gary the DM:  Would be. You get breakfast and lunch.

111:00 Gary the DM:  There's a small like, you know, restaurant there.

111:02 Gary the DM:  And you can smell some. Some food wafting in from.

111:06 Gary the DM:  From that. Which. Which smells amazing right now.

111:10 Gary the DM:  You get up to the.

111:15 Gary the DM:  You get up to the. The desk as you guys walk in and this human woman is.

111:24 Gary the DM:  Is sitting behind. Standing behind the desk.

111:27 Gary the DM:  Immediately Gets excited and says are you guys going to stay here at the Silver Mist? We have available rooms.

111:35 Gary the DM:  You can get them cleaned for you in.

111:37 Gary the DM:  In a matter of minutes. In fact, while we clean it, you can have a complimentary appetizer at our wonderful

111:45 Gary the DM:  little restaurant here.

111:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  What's your going rate for four men in one room?

111:52 Gary the DM:  Four men in one room.

111:57 Chris as Boon:  What about a mushroom.

112:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Half man and one man.

112:07 Gary the DM:  For you? And I've seen you folks around in town and Littlefinger there has been in town for.

112:16 Gary the DM:  For some time.

112:21 Gary the DM:  Do you have a place the price A little bit.

112:23 Gary the DM:  We've had some. Some minor incidents with.

112:27 Gary the DM:  With you. But how about two goal pieces and that comes with for each of you guys a complimentary breakfast

112:36 Gary the DM:  in the morning.

112:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Pretty good rate.

112:45 Chris as Boon:  I'm just curious. Does Donkey live here and does Littlefinger live here?

112:50 Vic as Littlefinger:  I do.

112:50 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Donkey. Donkey would have an.

112:55 Gary the DM:  So would Littlefinger. You three, I don't think.

112:58 Gary the DM:  Would you guys. I think from back to your backgrounds are well, outsiders.

113:02 Chris as Boon:  Right.

113:05 Gary the DM:  And Donkey for sure what he established his like he's been in this town for a long time.

113:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay. So I assume Donkey and Little Finger want to sleep over because we're having so much fun, right?

113:16 Gary the DM:  They might. And Little, I guess you could stay.

113:19 Gary the DM:  Little Fingers may have a small home, I guess.

113:22 Gary the DM:  Littlefinger, would you want them to stay in your home.

113:28 Gary the DM:  Right now Donkey's sick so no one wants to stay there.

113:31 Chris as Boon:  True.

113:33 Vic as Littlefinger:  It's a halfling sized home. I don't want my work friend to be comfortable.

113:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  I want, you know, my work friend to be comfortable.

113:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  I don't think that I have the facilities to handle what Ginkgo needs.

113:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm not sure about that. But I want him to be comfortable as well.

113:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  So I think if we stay at the end we have more room and can have a base of operations

113:54 Vic as Littlefinger:  together. Because at some point I'm going to want to slink off by myself to do some questioning and some

114:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  rogue types stuff as you're probably going to go investigating at some point.

114:05 Vic as Littlefinger:  I. I don't know if it's appropriate for me to just start talking to y' all like we're privately having

114:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  a conversation. But like I think we stay in the end collect.

114:13 Vic as Littlefinger:  It's two gold pieces for all of us to have a single room.

114:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  But probably when we rest I would go off to my own place.

114:19 Vic as Littlefinger:  I still think we should get the.

114:21 Vic as Littlefinger:  The hotel.

114:21 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

114:22 Gary the DM:  It's really long thing to say.

114:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And we.

114:26 Chris as Boon:  We've been chatting on the way to the end, so.

114:28 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

114:29 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

114:29 Vic as Littlefinger:  Excellent mute control Ginko. Excellent mute control.

114:32 Vic as Littlefinger:  Well, well done, Ginko. I never would do that.

114:37 Gary the DM:  So. So can I. Can I sign you up for a room?

114:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think so. I don't want to be Gandalf in the Baggins.

114:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Hobbit hole is.

114:47 Gary the DM:  We have the festival tomorrow. I assume you'd want to stay for the festival and beyond.

114:52 Gary the DM:  So should I book it for multiple days? I could book it for five days for you be five gold

114:58 Gary the DM:  pieces you have now and you have the room for.

115:00 Gary the DM:  For a full five days. That'd be.

115:05 Gary the DM:  And you don't have to worry about any of your establishments.

115:07 Gary the DM:  You can be for the festival and beyond.

115:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I think we do that.

115:14 Gary the DM:  I think that's a great choice.

115:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Why do I feel like I just got up.

115:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Sold.

115:23 Chris as Boon:  Five gold. Feels like a lot for a room.

115:27 Chris as Boon:  I mean, five gold, you know, that's like a.

115:29 Chris as Boon:  What you pay for a custom made weapon or something.

115:34 Chris as Boon:  I feel like. I feel like maybe we could get a deal.

115:36 Gary the DM:  It's five gold pieces or. No, it's a.

115:39 Gary the DM:  You have 10 gold pieces, I think.

115:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think five of them front, five at the end of our stay.

115:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Just to make sure the service is adequate and everything.

115:54 Gary the DM:  That's you. You. You counter offer her.

115:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

115:59 Gary the DM:  I guess. Give me diplomacy, Jack.

116:02 Chris as Boon:  Do that.

116:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Take guidance.

116:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  15.

116:14 Gary the DM:  15. All right. So.

116:22 Gary the DM:  He thinks for a second.

116:29 Gary the DM:  I'm now in five and five days.

116:36 Gary the DM:  Okay. I'll write it down in the log.

116:42 Gary the DM:  Whose name am I going to hold accountable, Littlefinger?

116:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Absolutely.

116:52 Chris as Boon:  All right.

116:55 Gary the DM:  Very well. They said give us about five minutes and we'll have your room ready.

117:02 Gary the DM:  Please step right next door and you can have one of our premiere entry.

117:08 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah, let's get some grub. Let's sit down.

117:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  Let's start planning.

117:12 Gary the DM:  Yep. You guys. You guys walk over to the left there and there's several open tables.

117:20 Gary the DM:  There's only a couple people in here.

117:22 Gary the DM:  There's a. There's like, you know, a bar maid.

117:25 Gary the DM:  She's cleaning a table as you guys walk up and just please sit anywhere you like, anywhere you like.

117:30 Gary the DM:  And shuffles off behind this, you know, kind of back in the kitchen area.

117:35 Gary the DM:  You can hear some. Some clanging going on as the activity starts up there as the rest of the people

117:40 Gary the DM:  just seem to be drinking like tea and maybe have like a.

117:44 Gary the DM:  Some type of biscuit type of thing in front of them.

117:46 Gary the DM:  A very light kind of. Kind of affair.

117:48 Gary the DM:  And lady comes back out and puts down two menus essentially in front of the table.

117:57 Gary the DM:  And it says, I'll get you water immediately and I'll be back with whatever you'd like to Order, see, shuffles

118:03 Gary the DM:  back, then comes back. Pour some cups of water for you.

118:06 Gary the DM:  They're small, kind of like definitely beer steins like you'd see in the classic, like, you know, German style.

118:12 Gary the DM:  They're smaller cups and then leaves like a flask of water that's in a clay pot kind of thing on

118:18 Gary the DM:  the table with the rest of the.

118:19 Gary the DM:  And then goes back briefly, has an apron on now that she didn't have before.

118:26 Gary the DM:  And she says, welcome, welcome. How may I help you? What can I get you? Today we have kind of

118:38 Gary the DM:  a modified menu, so not everything that you see is.

118:41 Gary the DM:  Is there, but may I recommend some of the.

118:45 Gary the DM:  The fish is fresh today, obviously, and so that's some of our best dishes that we make.

118:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Fish sounds great. And a pint of your orcish ale, please.

119:07 Gary the DM:  You said orcish ale, sir?

119:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Of course. What else do you drink? Appear.

119:16 Gary the DM:  I don't think. I don't believe we have any orcish ale, but we do have some other beverages that you

119:27 Gary the DM:  may find appealing.

119:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Whatever is the strongest.

119:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  What kind of. What kind of teas do you have?

119:48 Gary the DM:  We have some. Some wonderful teas yet.

119:51 Gary the DM:  We have some herbal teas as well as some black teas.

119:57 Gary the DM:  And my favorite is a. Just a BlackBerry blend that we make.

120:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, that sounds delicious. I will have that.

120:08 Gary the DM:  What? Mr. Littlefinger?

120:14 Vic as Littlefinger:  Wine, please.

120:17 Gary the DM:  And I'm. I'm sorry, I. I haven't seen a dwarf before.

120:24 Gary the DM:  I assume that's what you are.

120:28 Gary the DM:  What would. What do dwarfs drink?

120:32 Chris as Boon:  A boon. Pineappleager.

120:38 Gary the DM:  A lager, sir.

120:43 Chris as Boon:  Do you have lager?

120:44 Gary the DM:  We have a wine.

120:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  And my dwarven friend likes mead, I believe as well.

120:50 Vic as Littlefinger:  Any meads?

120:52 Gary the DM:  We do make a meadow.

120:55 Chris as Boon:  Made. Sounds great.

120:57 Gary the DM:  All right, one. One mead, one tea.

121:00 Gary the DM:  One of our strongest alcohol.

121:07 Gary the DM:  And what did you order?

121:08 Vic as Littlefinger:  Little finger simple glass of wine, please.

121:12 Gary the DM:  So goes back, gets your drinks, comes back out and.

121:16 Gary the DM:  And puts them in front of.

121:19 Gary the DM:  Of folks and. And it gives you guys time to plan and discuss as she brings out some.

121:28 Gary the DM:  A complimentary appetizer. Basically it's like a calamari kind of uh, a dish there that you guys can.

121:38 Gary the DM:  Can all sample. And then, uh, she.

121:43 Gary the DM:  She looks at uh, at Boone and says,

121:52 Gary the DM:  we have. We have like potatoes and I could get some.

122:02 Gary the DM:  I know underground. Like we have some mushrooms that they're on the surface.

122:08 Gary the DM:  They're not underground though. Would you eat that?

122:12 Chris as Boon:  When she says mushrooms, I try not to look at my Leshy friend, my new acquaintance, and I say potatoes

122:25 Chris as Boon:  and fish sounds great.

122:28 Oded as Ginkgo:  Ginkgo nods slowly.

122:35 Gary the DM:  So she brings out the food.

122:36 Gary the DM:  And you Guys are at the table.

122:38 Gary the DM:  Like I said, there's not a lot of other people that come in.

122:40 Gary the DM:  It's pretty quiet and in this area, so.

122:49 Chris as Boon:  All right, what's the plan?

122:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So while you guys start planning, Baishan's just going to eat in silence.

122:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Eat and drink.

123:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You do the eating first. Not that any of you would know that.

123:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You do.

123:13 Vic as Littlefinger:  You. That's okay. I assume you can listen while you're shoveling.

123:20 Vic as Littlefinger:  So the mission, as I understand it, is to prevent anything that could interrupt or dishonor the incoming oni.

123:33 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're at the end where the old ruling family is staying.

123:38 Vic as Littlefinger:  I have connections with that family.

123:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  And so,

123:46 Vic as Littlefinger:  you know, I. After we eat, have a drink or two to reduce my inhibitions.

123:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  I was thinking to go meet some of my old contacts in the family and see if they had anything

123:57 Vic as Littlefinger:  planned or if they were responding, responsible.

123:59 Vic as Littlefinger:  Just ask some questions about, hey, did you guys see that? How cool that fireworks explosion was? And see if

124:04 Vic as Littlefinger:  I can gather any information from contacts in my own family about what's going down and if they've got anything

124:10 Vic as Littlefinger:  else planned.

124:19 Chris as Boon:  Well, I don't know anybody here, so, I mean, I could start talking to random people, but there's got to

124:24 Chris as Boon:  be something better I can do.

124:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think. I think, Boone, we should.

124:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We should start networking. In the end, you know, liquor loosens everyone's lips, and I imagine Littlefinger wouldn't want us

124:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  accompanying Oman, ruining his stealth.

124:41 Vic as Littlefinger:  That's right. Also my vibe.

124:46 Gary the DM:  You know, the little finger. You're gonna go some of the.

124:51 Gary the DM:  Of your contacts, Un and Sean are going to, I guess, talk to some folks in the inn.

125:03 Gary the DM:  There's a. So there's the. In Silvermen Inn that you guys are in.

125:06 Gary the DM:  Like I said, it's not as active as.

125:13 Gary the DM:  As it might be in, like, it's heyday.

125:15 Gary the DM:  So very few people are staying there.

125:16 Gary the DM:  You know that the family are staying here.

125:22 Gary the DM:  You haven't seen them so far, but they were kicked out of the estate and are temporarily staying here until

125:27 Gary the DM:  the magistrate leaves. So, you know that the.

125:35 Gary the DM:  There is a tavern that a lot of the locals go to, and that won't really happen until the evening.

125:43 Gary the DM:  And tomorrow evening is when the.

125:47 Gary the DM:  The mayor is supposed to arrive.

125:49 Gary the DM:  But after people go to work, they generally, you know, some folks will go and get a, you know, after

125:55 Gary the DM:  work, either dinner, celebration beer at a local tavern, which is, you know, on the.

126:00 Gary the DM:  The riverside as well. So you could go there if you want to, like, get some scuttlebutt or something.

126:08 Gary the DM:  That might be a good place to go as well, it's called the Luckless Cod, and it.

126:16 Gary the DM:  It's a small tavern on the other side, and some of the locals might.

126:21 Gary the DM:  Might be there. That'd be another place to go.

126:23 Chris as Boon:  And then.

126:24 Gary the DM:  Ginko, what are you doing?

126:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm sipping some tea, and then I want to flatter the server for the tea and try and develop a

126:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  conversation about what's going on in.

126:38 Oded as Ginkgo:  In the inn and with the family.

126:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Maybe ask about them a bit and see if I can get any information.

126:48 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

126:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  Flattery.

126:51 Gary the DM:  So are you guys all splitting up now or.

126:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Or.

126:53 Gary the DM:  Or not?

126:55 Vic as Littlefinger:  We gotta finish eating.

126:58 Gary the DM:  What was that?

127:00 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think I wasn't thinking. We split up till after we all got done.

127:04 Vic as Littlefinger:  Finished eating. I wanted to watch my man Ginkgo make his moves on the server.

127:08 Vic as Littlefinger:  Yeah, he's laying down his game here, so.

127:12 Chris as Boon:  Yeah. All right.

127:17 Gary the DM:  So. So she comes back, you know, takes plates that.

127:23 Gary the DM:  That you guys have finished, and she builds second round of drinks for you guys and says that's the.

127:35 Gary the DM:  Unfortunately, that's the last of the complimentary items that I can provide you.

127:39 Gary the DM:  But very much appreciate you dining with us.

127:44 Gary the DM:  And if you're staying longer, I hope that you visit again and share.

127:51 Gary the DM:  Share with others our good hospitality.

127:54 Gary the DM:  Very much appreciate any visitors that we can have.

127:57 Gary the DM:  It's been a quiet season, we'll say.

128:08 Gary the DM:  And so she gathers stuff up and there's anything else I can get you?

128:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Are we done eating or are we gonna.

128:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  My shine could eat more.

128:22 Gary the DM:  Don't.

128:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Don't get me wrong. If you.

128:24 Gary the DM:  If you want, you have to pay for the next ones.

128:26 Gary the DM:  But. But that was the last of the

128:33 Gary the DM:  complimentary items.

128:37 Chris as Boon:  Oh, go ahead.

128:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  How much for a roasted fish hole?

128:43 Gary the DM:  She said one silver piece.

128:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll do that for the rest of you.

128:47 Vic as Littlefinger:  Having.

128:52 Vic as Littlefinger:  I just have the same as you.

128:54 Gary the DM:  Yeah, just a fish. All right.

128:57 Vic as Littlefinger:  Fishing some lines. Yeah.

129:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Make sure on the bones whole.

129:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The whole thing.

129:06 Gary the DM:  It's got the head and tail on it and a half a lemon there if you want to squeeze on

129:12 Gary the DM:  it.

129:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't need. I don't need fruit.

129:20 Gary the DM:  And so she. She go. Anybody else? I guess just those two.

129:24 Gary the DM:  So she goes back and after, you know, 10 minutes or so, she brings the.

129:30 Gary the DM:  Brings the fish out. And yeah, it's a pretty big, like, trout kind of fish laying with a few greens

129:37 Gary the DM:  on it. And then like a lemon that you could use a half 11 that you could squeeze on if

129:41 Gary the DM:  you want to do that. And she thanks you guys and starts cleaning up some other areas of the kitchen.

129:51 Gary the DM:  And that's when

129:55 Gary the DM:  singing kind of like lullaby kind of song kind of comes in, and you guys turn and look, and there's

130:02 Gary the DM:  another Leshy who walks into the Silvermist Inn.

130:07 Gary the DM:  And she's young, beautiful, flowery Leshy.

130:16 Gary the DM:  I guess I don't know what you call them.

130:17 Gary the DM:  It's. And you've seen her before.

130:20 Gary the DM:  She runs a small business here called the Dew Drop Petals, which is the place that you can get manicures,

130:32 Gary the DM:  your hair styled. And she walks in, and she's smiling and she's singing song, and she's like, dear, you have

130:42 Gary the DM:  to get your hair done before the.

130:44 Gary the DM:  The festival tonight. As she pulls with the.

130:48 Gary the DM:  The hostess's hair and says, this long, beautiful hair must be in a braid.

130:52 Gary the DM:  We can put some flowers in here.

130:54 Gary the DM:  And then she turns and sees you guys sitting there, and she immediately forgets who she was talking to at

131:00 Gary the DM:  the. At the table or at the entry and scampers over, almost skips over, and then sits down at a

131:09 Gary the DM:  stool as she pulls it from a table nearby with.

131:12 Gary the DM:  With you folks and says, now, if this isn't the most interesting group I've ever seen, I am radiant.

131:21 Gary the DM:  Willow. You can call me Willow.

131:23 Gary the DM:  And I have a small shop near here.

131:26 Gary the DM:  I know you know this. You should visit more often.

131:29 Gary the DM:  Littlefinger, your hands are dreadful. We could do wonders to soften those for you.

131:36 Gary the DM:  But we can do amazing things, like.

131:40 Gary the DM:  And she reaches out and twists some of the beard that Boone has and says, we must style this nest

131:51 Gary the DM:  that you have here. Only a few blocks down, I have my shop, and we can get you in a

131:57 Gary the DM:  chair and we can style your beard, your hair, your hands, your feet.

132:06 Gary the DM:  And if you want, I do some consulting for some of this.

132:09 Gary the DM:  And she reaches out to your.

132:11 Gary the DM:  Your shirt and says, rather drab.

132:14 Gary the DM:  We could. We can. We can upscale that as well.

132:17 Gary the DM:  I'm happy to do fashion suggestions, go make them, but I do have a good eye.

132:26 Chris as Boon:  So is anybody else within, like, earshot of us, or is it just her and our group at the table?

132:31 Gary the DM:  So essentially, it's you guys at the table.

132:33 Gary the DM:  There's the. The hostess or the lady that hostess lady, the waitress that you've been talking with, and then the

132:43 Gary the DM:  other lady who is in the.

132:46 Gary the DM:  That works for the. The concierge basically, of the hotel at the end.

132:52 Gary the DM:  No one else is in this.

132:54 Gary the DM:  This area. And other than one other person that has kind of come in into the.

133:00 Gary the DM:  The end, you haven't seen anybody else.

133:02 Gary the DM:  Like I said, there's not a lot of people staying here, it seems like.

133:07 Chris as Boon:  So we know who the boy was.

133:09 Chris as Boon:  I'll ask Willow. You know, that explosion earlier.

133:12 Chris as Boon:  We rescued those kids. Who was that girl who we rescued?

133:17 Gary the DM:  Wow.

133:22 Gary the DM:  Oh, I. I saw that. Saw the explosion.

133:25 Gary the DM:  You know, it's hard not to just right across there.

133:28 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Kimmy, I hear was rescued as well as the.

133:33 Gary the DM:  The blacksmith's boy as well. Yeah, the.

133:41 Gary the DM:  Is the young daughter of.

133:48 Gary the DM:  She runs the paper shop in town.

133:57 Chris as Boon:  Okay, good. Yeah, we thought we might check up on them in a little bit, but I have no idea

134:04 Chris as Boon:  what else to say. First, I'm just going to.

134:05 Chris as Boon:  Looking around at you guys.

134:08 Gary the DM:  I think madam, she was very happy to.

134:12 Gary the DM:  To see that her. Her daughter was safe.

134:14 Gary the DM:  It's very scary. Very scary indeed, but very.

134:20 Gary the DM:  She said you saved them. I heard that.

134:22 Gary the DM:  That they were rescued, but I didn't hear who did.

134:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Was Boone. Are these.

134:31 Chris as Boon:  Are these kids.

134:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Are they known for being mischievous? Do they normally get into trouble?

134:40 Gary the DM:  Not so much. The Han. The.

134:44 Gary the DM:  The young blacksmith boy, he's known to be rambunctious, but nothing, nothing like that.

134:53 Gary the DM:  Nothing where, you know, they would, you know, cause a fire like that.

135:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And being the blacksmith's boy, I'd imagine he has a respect for fire and wouldn't be the type to go

135:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  lighting fires or playing with fire.

135:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Does that sound right to you?

135:12 Gary the DM:  Yeah, we think so. He seems like, you know, energetic, adventurous young boy.

135:19 Gary the DM:  But they seem to be a close family.

135:23 Gary the DM:  Respectful of his father, works in the forge sometimes times as well when he can.

135:28 Gary the DM:  So they. I wouldn't say he's a black sheep of their family or anything, so I'd be.

135:38 Gary the DM:  I. I think it was unfortunate that they were in there.

135:40 Gary the DM:  I. I could only imagine that they were looking at the.

135:43 Gary the DM:  At the stash like, you know, kids do like fireworks.

135:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Absolutely no.

135:52 Gary the DM:  Do you mind any ornate things on your tusks?

136:00 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Decoration is for the weak. These tusks are for work, not display.

136:07 Gary the DM:  Now I find that a little bit offensive, sir.

136:13 Gary the DM:  How could you not want to? You're a strong, proud Orcish man.

136:22 Gary the DM:  Those are, you know, emblems of your heritage.

136:26 Gary the DM:  You should. You should play them up way more than you do.

136:30 Gary the DM:  We could cap them and. We could even cap them and put like a little bit of.

136:35 Gary the DM:  I think with your. Your skin, a ruby would look great or perhaps diamond.

136:40 Gary the DM:  But we put that on the end of the test.

136:43 Gary the DM:  It would be. I bet there's no other orc that has that.

136:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I would bet you're right. Blunting the tusks with decorative jewels is not the orcish way.

136:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  These are for the display. Should be their prowess and their might, not how fancy they look.

137:05 Gary the DM:  Well, I'm not A warrior, obviously.

137:10 Gary the DM:  And, you know, I don't. I don't deal in those matters, but I just can't stay in a world of

137:16 Gary the DM:  drab. And, you know, the why you can't make everything beautiful is beyond me.

137:24 Gary the DM:  There's people who, you know, I can even look at a knife and you can engrave it with some beautiful

137:31 Gary the DM:  writings and phrases and sayings and scenes.

137:36 Gary the DM:  So why not your tusks? Why not everything? I think everything is a canvas for beauty.

137:41 Gary the DM:  Don't you think? And she looks at Ginkgo.

137:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, I would totally agree. Everything Mother Nature makes is beautiful.

137:52 Oded as Ginkgo:  Including you, Willow, of course.

137:55 Gary the DM:  Me?

137:57 Chris as Boon:  Yes.

137:58 Gary the DM:  Have you not seen a more adorable Leshy in your life? And she stands up and does like a little

138:04 Gary the DM:  pirouette.

138:06 Oded as Ginkgo:  I have never. You are by far the most beautiful.

138:12 Gary the DM:  Now you. Now you're just flattering me.

138:14 Gary the DM:  And. And I like it. I'll be honest.

138:17 Oded as Ginkgo:  What. What. What do you think? Can you find the beauty in our incoming governor? Mayor?

138:27 Gary the DM:  Well, I haven't seen the mayor yet, and I hope.

138:32 Gary the DM:  I hope he comes here with.

138:34 Gary the DM:  With good intentions and makes this town something that we could be a little bit more proud of and.

138:43 Gary the DM:  And smile a little bit more.

138:45 Gary the DM:  There's been so many. Life is rough here, and I don't know if it has to be like we can

138:50 Gary the DM:  find the joy in things. So I'm hopeful.

138:53 Gary the DM:  But until he gets here, I'm reserving my judgment.

138:58 Gary the DM:  His,

139:02 Gary the DM:  I guess. His early. The magistrate.

139:12 Gary the DM:  Beautiful blue skin. Gorgeous. That is amazing.

139:19 Gary the DM:  However, he's always. Always stern. You know, he could.

139:26 Gary the DM:  I think he could make more friends with.

139:28 Gary the DM:  With smiles than. Than the. Than the commanding style that he has right now.

139:34 Gary the DM:  But he hasn't bothered me so far.

139:37 Gary the DM:  And, you know, I think he.

139:38 Gary the DM:  So far, he, you know, is trying to provide order in the town.

139:43 Gary the DM:  And so maybe that's a welcome.

139:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Does he bother others? Are there any that you feel do not get along with.

139:56 Oded as Ginkgo:  With him?

140:03 Gary the DM:  Give me a diplomacy.

140:06 Chris as Boon:  Ch.

140:17 Gary the DM:  Eight. All right. So Willow says.

140:22 Gary the DM:  Now,

140:26 Gary the DM:  I. I've heard things. There's. Like I said, you need to come to my shop.

140:32 Gary the DM:  I believe that you definitely need to do it tomorrow.

140:37 Gary the DM:  Can I book you all for an appointment tomorrow before the mayor arrives, so that you can look your best?

140:43 Gary the DM:  When the mayor arrives. But as people sit there and we talk, as I make them more endearing to others

140:55 Gary the DM:  and to themselves, there's people who talk and they say things.

141:00 Gary the DM:  Sure. Do I want to repeat those.

141:04 Gary the DM:  Those rumors? No. But sometimes people just talk.

141:09 Gary the DM:  So I've heard some things.

141:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  Well, I think we have plans for tomorrow morning.

141:18 Oded as Ginkgo:  Then.

141:21 Gary the DM:  She smiles and this is all for.

141:26 Gary the DM:  So I have a. Would you like to be.

141:31 Gary the DM:  Would you like the. A full treatment? I'm gonna take a couple hours.

141:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm busy then.

141:38 Chris as Boon:  Oh, this sounds like a job for Ginkgo.

141:46 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, I'm not sure if we'll have time for the full treatment, but we will absolutely stop by.

141:52 Gary the DM:  I will. I will style your hair.

141:54 Gary the DM:  I'll give you a discount, because once you've experienced it, in fact, once you see some other folks in town

142:00 Gary the DM:  who have partaken of my shop, I think you may reconsider.

142:07 Gary the DM:  Even you. I will get you to adorn your tus one day.

142:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That'll be the day.

142:16 Gary the DM:  And you. I would love to break your beard.

142:26 Chris as Boon:  We'll see.

142:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I can speak from experience that you won't ever get the braids out.

142:33 Gary the DM:  And. And you, Littlefinger.

142:34 Chris as Boon:  What?

142:36 Gary the DM:  We could do something with your hand.

142:38 Gary the DM:  And like you said, your hands.

142:40 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm quite fond of my top knot.

142:42 Vic as Littlefinger:  Keeps things out of my. Out of my face while I'm.

142:45 Vic as Littlefinger:  While I'm roguing. So, you know, I really.

142:50 Vic as Littlefinger:  I've got some appointments tomorrow. I've got some things to investigate, and, you know, we're tasked with, you know, keeping

142:56 Vic as Littlefinger:  things safe. So I really think you and Ginkgo should enjoy some quiet time together and, well, do some lushy

143:05 Vic as Littlefinger:  stuff.

143:07 Gary the DM:  Well, if it's. I'm happy. I'm happy to help you, Ginkgo.

143:13 Gary the DM:  I wish that the rest of your group would not be so embarrassed that it's.

143:20 Gary the DM:  It is manly to look beautiful.

143:23 Vic as Littlefinger:  Hey, I'm a huge fan of pedicures.

143:25 Vic as Littlefinger:  I mean, I think it's fantastic to get those corns rubbed off your toes and have the foot massage that

143:31 Vic as Littlefinger:  comes with it. I will definitely swing by.

143:33 Vic as Littlefinger:  I'm sure you've got some of that fancy cucumber water that I can grab a couple of sips of at

143:39 Vic as Littlefinger:  your spa and make sure that I'll at least make sure Ginkgo gets there safely and.

143:45 Vic as Littlefinger:  And then head out for my errands.

143:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think we will all make sure Ginkgo gets there safely.

143:49 Vic as Littlefinger:  I think we should. I think we should.

143:50 Chris as Boon:  We'll.

143:51 Vic as Littlefinger:  We'll make sure Ginkgo shows.

143:52 Gary the DM:  So she stands up, she goes, I.

143:54 Gary the DM:  I hope to see you all then tomorrow.

143:56 Gary the DM:  And. And I. I can't wait to see what we can do with you, Ginkgo.

144:00 Gary the DM:  And.

144:01 Chris as Boon:  And.

144:01 Gary the DM:  Oh, one last thing before I go.

144:04 Gary the DM:  Do come early tomorrow right around sunset, right after sunset, before the.

144:10 Gary the DM:  The actual parade starts or the mayor.

144:13 Gary the DM:  I am doing a dance, so I hope you all can see that.

144:18 Gary the DM:  And you all will be in awe of how well your.

144:22 Gary the DM:  Your friend Ginkgo here looks tomorrow.

144:25 Gary the DM:  I hope to. I hope to see you in the morning then.

144:27 Gary the DM:  And it was nice talking to you all.

144:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You as well.

144:31 Chris as Boon:  You as well.

144:34 Gary the DM:  So she leaves. It's already 10 o'.

144:37 Gary the DM:  Clock. So we'll end it there for tonight with you guys leaving the inn and see what happens after that.

144:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That was a great.

144:51 Vic as Littlefinger:  Are we gonna set like, activities that happen while we're away type stuff like what happens next? I guess is

145:02 Vic as Littlefinger:  my question.

145:04 Gary the DM:  We basically continue where we left off for the most part.

145:08 Chris as Boon:  What time of day is it again? Yeah.

145:10 Gary the DM:  For you guys, it's probably mid morning right now.

145:14 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

145:15 Vic as Littlefinger:  We're drinking. We're already drinking. Y' all like it?

145:18 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

145:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Why are you surprised?

145:24 Gary the DM:  So.

145:25 Chris as Boon:  Yeah.

145:25 Gary the DM:  So, yeah. Well, it's like it's on pause.

145:28 Gary the DM:  So, like it's the next episode of the TV series that I'll pick up sometimes.

145:34 Gary the DM:  I'll play around with time, but for the most part, I pick up where we left off.

145:40 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I do love that the waitress didn't even balk at me ordering the strongest alcohol they had in the mid

145:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  morning. I like this place.

145:50 Gary the DM:  Should be fun. And then we'll have.

145:53 Gary the DM:  Hopefully everybody can be back next week and then we'll see what happens with the ceremony coming up, which we'll

146:01 Gary the DM:  probably hit on.

146:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, and then the week of the 17th, February 17th, I will actually be in Nashville for work.

146:09 Gary the DM:  Oh, no way.

146:11 Chris as Boon:  Okay.

146:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. If we want. Yeah. And I'll be there.

146:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. I finally get to go to kickoff even though I'm not a director.

146:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But I'll be there Thursday night.

146:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Even I don't fly out till Friday in case we want to do anything.

146:25 Gary the DM:  Okay, so you'll be there 17th through.

146:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The 19th, I think that sounds right.

146:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Yeah. Tuesday through Friday.

146:33 Gary the DM:  Okay, that's good. I don't know if we can maybe try to all meet.

146:39 Gary the DM:  That'd be kind of cool. And do something in person.

146:42 Gary the DM:  Whether we play a game or not or just hang out would be fun.

146:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Because, Chris, you're in Nashville too, right?

146:48 Chris as Boon:  Yeah. Yeah, Franklin Nashville.

146:50 Gary the DM:  Okay. Maybe we could chat about that and see what we want to do.

146:57 Gary the DM:  That'd be kind of fun. Cool.

147:01 Gary the DM:  Awesome.

147:03 Chris as Boon:  Do you live in Knoxville?

147:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Not.
