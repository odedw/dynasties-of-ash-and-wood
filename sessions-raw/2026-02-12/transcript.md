00:00 Gary the DM:  To Hong Little boy came into the silver Ms.

00:04 Gary the DM:  Den after being reunited with with Donkey and he was nervous, evasive.

00:15 Gary the DM:  But in the interrogation you learned that that he was actually getting some money from the ASO family, the ruling

00:26 Gary the DM:  family, and a pretty good sum to Azarakis.

00:32 Gary the DM:  No one was supposed to get hurt and luckily no one did.

00:34 Gary the DM:  But he was there to collect on his.

00:41 Gary the DM:  On his earnings. You guys talked to Elder Mido Yesho who's the matriarch of the family.

00:49 Gary the DM:  Learn a little bit more information about that.

00:54 Gary the DM:  She promises that there will be no more incidents to talk to you guys.

01:00 Gary the DM:  As you revealed your, I guess loose affiliation with the magistrate and Warren, she warned you about him.

01:07 Gary the DM:  And that's when you guys ventured north to get to the Dark woods where the Mourn Dust Willow is within

01:14 Gary the DM:  there. Because that's. The magistrate supposedly visited the tree a couple times since he's been there over the past couple

01:21 Gary the DM:  days. Don't know why, but you guys are investigating.

01:24 Gary the DM:  On the way he passed by the.

01:28 Gary the DM:  The graveyard which is to the north of the of Willow Shore, in between that and the Dark woods.

01:34 Gary the DM:  And that's when the undead awoke and he got into a little scuffle with a very vicious cat and a

01:47 Gary the DM:  ghoul and a zombie and. But you're able to luckily get rid of those threats.

01:53 Gary the DM:  And that's where we ended. You guys ended basically there.

01:57 Gary the DM:  A little bit of follow up.

01:58 Chris as Boone:  The.

02:01 Gary the DM:  The grave keeper, she came back eventually, was all frazzled, you know, said that, you know, this has never happened

02:09 Gary the DM:  before. Place the crickets back where they were and she left some rice cakes on several graves, hopeful that will,

02:17 Gary the DM:  you know, appease the. The hungry dead.

02:21 Gary the DM:  And you guys started to venture north towards the Dark woods which is just north of Willow Shore.

02:29 Gary the DM:  That's where we ended last time.

02:32 Gary the DM:  So we'll pick up there where Littlefinger decides to stay in case he stays back at the.

02:39 Gary the DM:  In Willowshore and the graveyard. Um, just in case something happens again while you guys are off, you can, you

02:46 Gary the DM:  can help out the town, keep an eye on the magistrate or when he comes back.

02:51 Gary the DM:  So doing a little bit of scouting work in the city and also protect folks if the.

02:56 Gary the DM:  The other undead decide to wake up, you know, uninvited, I guess.

03:02 Gary the DM:  And so that's what he decides to do is you guys venture forth to the north to get to this

03:09 Gary the DM:  Mourn Dust Tree.

03:11 Oded as Ginkgo:  What's. What's this session's name? Gary.

03:16 Gary the DM:  Mystery at the Mourn Dusk Willow.

03:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is that another investigation?

03:26 Gary the DM:  It might be.

03:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It might be.

03:30 Gary the DM:  The. So up ahead of you there's A little bit of a clearing.

03:36 Gary the DM:  The low gates and graveyard area is kind of circular with a low kind of fence line and the tombs

03:45 Gary the DM:  and stuff behind you as you venture forward to the north.

03:48 Gary the DM:  And the grass kind of rolling clearing greets you as kind of sways back and forth.

03:56 Gary the DM:  It's getting, you know, that was like mid afternoon, so it's getting closer to like 2 o' clock in the

04:01 Gary the DM:  afternoon. So the sun is starting to set a little bit and it's a nice breeze as.

04:04 Gary the DM:  But then you look in the distance you can see the tree line of the Dark woods, the edge of

04:11 Gary the DM:  the tree line. It feels heavy.

04:13 Gary the DM:  Like the trees are shoulder to shoulder.

04:17 Gary the DM:  Almost like if, if they were a phalanx of human like Roman soldiers.

04:22 Gary the DM:  Like there's definitely a protectiveness in the Dark Woods.

04:27 Gary the DM:  You don't, you know, the trees are obviously aren't moving, but they're dense.

04:31 Gary the DM:  It's very different than the rest of the area of willows.

04:35 Gary the DM:  And many of the trees of the Dark woods aren't willows to be fact.

04:39 Gary the DM:  In fact they're more of like a deciduous green tree with the weeping kind of flowy willows that are close

04:46 Gary the DM:  to the riverbank that gives Willow Shore its name.

04:50 Gary the DM:  The northern woods are more of a darker, like heavier, thicker trees.

04:56 Gary the DM:  They tower over the rest of the area a bit as you kind of walk forward into it as you

05:04 Gary the DM:  get into the woods, it's almost like the wind gets a little colder as you enter the tree line.

05:14 Gary the DM:  Donkey has been through this a few times probably in his years here.

05:19 Gary the DM:  And even while the Dark woods has.

05:21 Chris as Boone:  A.

05:24 Gary the DM:  Sinister reputation, you've never really felt any type of.

05:30 Gary the DM:  Your hair's never stand on end.

05:32 Gary the DM:  You never really got any sense that other than rumors and maybe you know, bad luck that it picked up

05:39 Gary the DM:  this reputation. Except today, walking into it today, it feels colder.

05:44 Gary the DM:  It feels different, separated in some way.

05:49 Gary the DM:  Like the cat walked right in front of me.

05:53 Gary the DM:  It's a little bit more distant.

05:55 Gary the DM:  There's something about it that's, that's definitely askew from when you've been in the Dark woods before.

06:01 Gary the DM:  And ginkgo, you know, like you pick up as you walk in, you know, through your feet.

06:06 Gary the DM:  Your, your natural, you know, Leshy feet.

06:11 Gary the DM:  You. I don't even know if you wear shoes.

06:13 Gary the DM:  You may not, but you feel.

06:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm sorry, absolutely not.

06:17 Gary the DM:  Okay.

06:18 David as Donkey:  I didn't think so.

06:20 Gary the DM:  Your feet, you know, or your pseudopods.

06:22 Gary the DM:  I don't know what you would call your feet there.

06:26 Gary the DM:  And it has like the earth also has like a darker, colder presence to it.

06:33 Gary the DM:  Just Entering this woods, I'd like to.

06:36 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'd like to pick up some earth and taste it and see if anything about the acidity feels different.

06:46 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

06:47 Gary the DM:  Give me a nature check.

06:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. Wait a minute. Wait a sec.

06:51 Oded as Ginkgo:  Let me open the character sheet.

07:07 Gary the DM:  If I launch. I wonder if I launch it here if it works better.

07:09 Gary the DM:  Okay. Anyway, let's try that. Maybe next time.

07:12 Gary the DM:  What'd you get?

07:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  It's still opening the character sheet.

07:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  Just a sec. Sorry.

07:18 Gary the DM:  That's right.

07:21 Oded as Ginkgo:  In the meantime, I. I'd love to ask Donkey describe the.

07:26 Oded as Ginkgo:  The ghost that we saw, describe its clothing and see if Donkey maybe recognizes who that person was or anything

07:37 Oded as Ginkgo:  like that.

07:37 Gary the DM:  Oh, the vision that you guys saw.

07:40 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

07:41 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Okay.

07:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think that should probably be one of my investigations at the identity of the spirit body.

07:49 Gary the DM:  Is that one of your questions? Who is the spirit?

07:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I think. Who is the spirit and why was he killed?

08:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think we gotta. I think we gotta figure that out.

08:06 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

08:09 Gary the DM:  Okay.

08:16 David as Donkey:  Should I do a willowshore lower check?

08:20 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I was gonna ask you to do either a society or willowshore.

08:24 Gary the DM:  Whichever one you have is better.

08:29 Gary the DM:  Oh, okay. So you smell the earth and taste it a bit.

08:37 Oded as Ginkgo:  That's. That's the Willowshore lore. I got an eight on the nitrous.

08:42 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

08:44 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you got an eight. The.

08:51 Gary the DM:  Get my other sheet up here.

08:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think technically Donkey gets a plus one on that as well since it's relevant to the Invest to the

09:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  mystery to the investigation.

09:06 Gary the DM:  Oh yeah. Think that is true.

09:09 Gary the DM:  That's the clue in or something like that, right?

09:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Pursue a lead. No, maybe it's clue in.

09:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Hold on.

09:16 Gary the DM:  I think it's the other one.

09:17 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

09:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's. It's clue in.

09:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And actually it's equivalent to my investigation.

09:32 Gary the DM:  Bonus, which is probably a one at first.

09:38 David as Donkey:  First level.

09:38 Gary the DM:  But.

09:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I'm trying to find that.

09:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I have no idea where that is.

09:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We can just go with the plus one for now.

10:05 Gary the DM:  Okay, so you. Other than. I guess with an 8, you didn't really gather much.

10:15 Gary the DM:  There is something about this area, but you don't.

10:20 Gary the DM:  You don't pick up any other insights or clues from the actual earth there.

10:27 Gary the DM:  It's definitely easily noticeable that there is some type of presence.

10:34 Gary the DM:  You both feel like maybe eyes watching you a little bit.

10:40 Gary the DM:  Little paranoia, looking over your shoulder.

10:42 Gary the DM:  You just kind of get this otherworldly or some other presence in the woods that wasn't there before.

10:49 Gary the DM:  It's not natural for, you know, for Donkey, it wasn't there before.

10:54 Gary the DM:  And for ginkgo, it's not a natural Presence that, that you sense.

11:00 Gary the DM:  And from the description,

11:05 Gary the DM:  it takes you a little while.

11:07 Gary the DM:  But there's a.

11:20 Gary the DM:  There's a visitor in town, recent visitor, probably arrived month, couple months before the magistrate did.

11:30 Gary the DM:  So was. Was pretty recent. He came through town.

11:37 Gary the DM:  He was from Absalom, which is not even tea and shots, a foreign continent.

11:43 Gary the DM:  Very few folks actually have arrived from there.

11:48 Gary the DM:  And his name, if you. You recall, his name was Cassian Voss.

11:54 Oded as Ginkgo:  Cassian Voss.

11:56 Gary the DM:  Cassian Voss.

12:00 Gary the DM:  He called himself a research.

12:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Did you mention what he was researching?

12:09 Gary the DM:  Let's see. What'd you get? A 26, was it? Yeah.

12:17 Gary the DM:  So he was a religious researcher and he was very interested in some of the other like TN shot gods

12:31 Gary the DM:  that he heard that aren't the ones that Absalom classically, you know, has in their pantheon.

12:38 Gary the DM:  And he, his specialty was what he called the old gods, that the gods before, similar to, I guess the

12:51 Gary the DM:  legends are kind of like the Greek mythology had the Titans before the Greek gods, that there was a group

12:58 Gary the DM:  of old gods, elder gods that were before the current known pantheon.

13:06 Gary the DM:  And so that was his specialty.

13:08 Gary the DM:  That's what he was researching. He was obviously interested in the Tnsha gods and that was interesting to him.

13:13 Gary the DM:  And see if there's any other histories or links to these stories of these old gods or who they might

13:18 Gary the DM:  have been or what they might have done.

13:20 Gary the DM:  There's very little. And that was his specialty.

13:22 Gary the DM:  He was around for like maybe a week or so, but.

13:26 Gary the DM:  And then moved on, you believe, you know, to move on to whatever his next journey and his researches took

13:32 Gary the DM:  took him. There wasn't any. You didn't leave anything.

13:36 Gary the DM:  There didn't seem to be any.

13:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You.

13:39 Gary the DM:  Know, murder or any, you know, maldo.

13:43 Gary the DM:  It just felt like he moved on.

13:45 Gary the DM:  He talked about doing that as well, so.

13:49 Gary the DM:  So you didn't think of much of it, but he was definitely someone that was noticeable.

13:53 Gary the DM:  And the attire that you described reminded Donkey of this.

13:58 Gary the DM:  Cassian, Cassian, boss, researcher.

14:03 Chris as Boone:  All right.

14:09 Gary the DM:  So you guys venture into the woods a little ways as Donkey knows where about this willow is.

14:19 Gary the DM:  And as you get closer, you can.

14:22 Gary the DM:  The forest is dense, kind of starts to get a little bit more open.

14:29 Gary the DM:  Trees are less close together and claustrophobic.

14:32 Gary the DM:  The canopy gets a little bit where sun is kind of peeking in and streaks as you walk closer.

14:40 Gary the DM:  And then up ahead you can see a area that is lit up.

14:45 Gary the DM:  It's an opening, it's a clearing.

14:47 Gary the DM:  So the, the sun, you know, the 3 o' clock sun is kind of shining down in this area up

14:52 Gary the DM:  ahead. And you can see as you guys walk Ahead a nice grass kind of rolling area of an open

14:59 Gary the DM:  clearing. And basically in the center of the clearing kind of like, you know, maybe at the 1/3 mark of

15:05 Gary the DM:  this clearing, it's kind of opens, you know, to the right there's this willow tree.

15:12 Gary the DM:  It's a weeping willow style tree, right with the, the hanging kind of branches, blackest black branches, dark, dark bark

15:22 Gary the DM:  on it. You can see its roots even going off to the right you know, in that clearing kind of

15:27 Gary the DM:  arc up and you know, kind of emerged like in a wave almost in the grass as it like seems

15:34 Gary the DM:  to spread out it veins or fingers through this clearing.

15:40 Gary the DM:  There's no dirt or any death or anything like that other than this dark black tree which is the, the

15:47 Gary the DM:  mourn dusk tree.

15:49 David as Donkey:  Are the, are the roots coming up at a particular spot or are they just coming up all over the

15:54 David as Donkey:  place?

15:56 Gary the DM:  They're coming up all over the place.

15:58 Gary the DM:  Yeah. So like the tree, if you look like, let's say it's like a oval right at the, you know,

16:07 Gary the DM:  2 3rd mark in the oval is the black born dust free.

16:11 Gary the DM:  You know it looks its branches are heavy, they droop down as these black kind of leaves kind of fall

16:16 Gary the DM:  from it every once in a while.

16:18 Gary the DM:  Kind of sways back and forth in the wind and then streaking out from it.

16:22 Gary the DM:  Its roots and its roots go deep and broad so they seem to expand.

16:27 Gary the DM:  You can see like little knuckles of them, you know, in the clearing.

16:31 Gary the DM:  You know, throughout it's quiet, birds are still chirping and other things.

16:38 Gary the DM:  So it's. Other than its unique kind of look, it is pretty much what a normal like green bright willow

16:47 Gary the DM:  tree that you've seen along the, along the, you know, Yasni river near Willowshore would be.

16:55 David as Donkey:  Are there any.

16:56 Gary the DM:  Pretty broad.

16:56 David as Donkey:  Are there any recent footprints or signs of disturbances.

17:02 Gary the DM:  Where you guys are? You guys are still.

17:03 Gary the DM:  I'm assuming you're not in the clearing yet, so you're still in the tree line.

17:06 Gary the DM:  But a survival check would give you if you could see anything near you or any disturbance that way.

17:18 Gary the DM:  Three for donkey.

17:20 David as Donkey:  Coming in hot.

17:22 Gary the DM:  You are rolling well. So from where you are at the tree line, I guess.

17:34 Gary the DM:  You don't notice. Well Z got 23 there.

17:39 Gary the DM:  I guess you don't see footprints but there does appear to be near the tree.

17:52 Gary the DM:  Some broken. You can make out some like push down grass area.

17:56 Gary the DM:  It's not like really high grass so it's pretty low.

17:59 Gary the DM:  But you can see where it.

18:00 Gary the DM:  It doesn't. It looks like it was broken down and pushed down a little bit like someone may have laid

18:05 Gary the DM:  there or walked there or something was dragged across there.

18:09 Gary the DM:  It doesn't. Because in that area, it doesn't sway like the.

18:13 Gary the DM:  The lower grass wood. It looks like it's matted down or was matted down.

18:18 Gary the DM:  We don't see any, like, defined footprints where you are right now.

18:26 David as Donkey:  Y' all want to go approach?

18:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

18:30 Chris as Boone:  Before we get too close, I'm gonna try to bind up some of these minor wounds that I have, so.

18:37 Chris as Boone:  Oh, yeah, See,

18:44 Chris as Boone:  Nine probably doesn't give me much.

18:48 Chris as Boone:  That's. That's fine. I'm not hurting too bad.

18:50 Chris as Boone:  I mean, I'm at 16 of 23.

18:54 David as Donkey:  I have some medicine. Some field medicine skill I can use too.

19:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I've got a. I've got a plus four if we need it, but I think you guys have higher.

19:08 Oded as Ginkgo:  Plus seven. Do I just roll medicine? Like, how.

19:12 Oded as Ginkgo:  How does that work?

19:13 Gary the DM:  Yeah, if you. If you have a medicine kit, yeah, you can.

19:18 Gary the DM:  You can roll, but technically only one person can do it if they're successful.

19:28 Gary the DM:  And then you. You'll heal. Hit points, and then, like, 10 minutes later, someone else can do treatment.

19:33 Gary the DM:  So unless you're using magic, if you're using just, like, natural medicines, there's, you know, a cool down time basically

19:42 Gary the DM:  where you. You have to. You can only treat them so much, so.

19:46 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right. In 10 minutes. Just give me 10 minutes.

19:53 Gary the DM:  So you got a nine.

20:00 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

20:00 Gary the DM:  I think you failed.

20:04 Chris as Boone:  I think so too.

20:05 Gary the DM:  You may have wrapped up any, like, bleeding wounds and things like that, but you weren't able to apply any

20:12 Gary the DM:  type of, you know, pain medication or anything like that.

20:16 Gary the DM:  That seemed to help. It still is a pretty sore wound.

20:20 Gary the DM:  It will probably be that way until you get some better attention to it.

20:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Shoot.

20:33 David as Donkey:  I'm.

20:34 Chris as Boone:  I'm fine to keep approaching if we want to, like, look around, kind of make our way closer.

20:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let's be cautious saying that.

20:44 Gary the DM:  So, yeah, you walk up to the tree, and I guess everybody give me a perception check.

21:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

21:09 Gary the DM:  Ginkgo and Boone. Oh, Abishan also.

21:15 Gary the DM:  So Dante was looking at that mad area, which turns out to not provide much information.

21:22 Gary the DM:  But as the rest of the group was looking around.

21:24 Gary the DM:  You're getting close to the tree.

21:28 Gary the DM:  As you know, the sun is starting to set, and it just lowers just enough, and you catch a glint

21:32 Gary the DM:  of, like, something shiny near the tree.

21:35 Gary the DM:  It's not on the tree, but it looks like in between where it's roots kind of stick out and kind

21:44 Gary the DM:  of arc out, there's a small, relatively large opening, I guess, in a kind of a pit between two roots.

21:55 Gary the DM:  It may have been dug, maybe natural, but it's definitely deeper than normal.

22:00 Gary the DM:  It's probably. Well, it's definitely deep.

22:02 Gary the DM:  It's probably like almost two feet deep of like a little gully in between two of the roots.

22:08 Gary the DM:  They kind of arc out from this tree pretty much at the base of the tree, maybe a foot away

22:13 Gary the DM:  from it. And there's. You catch a glimpse of something shiny on that.

22:18 Gary the DM:  In that pit there as you get closer to it.

22:22 Gary the DM:  I guess the other thing. You don't need a perception check for this.

22:24 Gary the DM:  As you guys get close to the tree from.

22:27 Gary the DM:  From afar, it looks, you know, dark black.

22:31 Gary the DM:  And typically that's what you've seen on the tree as well.

22:34 Gary the DM:  The donkey. When you've looked at it, it's like a black bark, black leaf, you know, very midnight black kind

22:39 Gary the DM:  of tree. Sometimes a velvety blue off the, you know, the sunlight.

22:44 Gary the DM:  Maybe you catch a glint of.

22:45 Gary the DM:  But as you got closer to it, and maybe this is why you were distracted as well.

22:51 Gary the DM:  It's got like a pale yellow to it.

22:55 Gary the DM:  Like something. Some growth has like exploded out from the tree.

23:00 Gary the DM:  It looks like from. It's not all the way around.

23:02 Gary the DM:  It's like moss might be right.

23:04 Gary the DM:  Moss is supposed to be like on the north side of a tree or something.

23:06 Gary the DM:  And in legend, right. So kind of like on the, you know, half of the tree, there's this yellowy kind

23:13 Gary the DM:  of lichens, like a moss type growth on it.

23:19 Gary the DM:  And it seems to have like shot out like almost like a shotgun out from that side of the tree.

23:25 Gary the DM:  Doesn't seem to be on any other side.

23:28 Gary the DM:  Just on basically the east side of the tree.

23:31 Gary the DM:  Kind of more where the clearing.

23:32 Gary the DM:  Where it faces the clearing on the.

23:35 Gary the DM:  On the right side.

23:36 Oded as Ginkgo:  Is this like a natural lichen or moss or does this seem like magical?

23:42 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I guess. Give me.

23:46 David as Donkey:  I can do a detect magic.

23:47 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can do detect magic for sure.

23:50 Gary the DM:  Donkey doesn't recall it being there, but it's been a while since you visited the tree.

23:56 Gary the DM:  But it is alarming the. The spread of it.

24:00 Gary the DM:  But don't know if it's natural or natural, I guess.

24:04 David as Donkey:  Do I have any intuitions about why it might be on the east side of the tree? Like, is there

24:10 David as Donkey:  something over there?

24:14 Gary the DM:  It's. It's where the sun rises, but you know, then the sun is setting on the other side, but the

24:24 Gary the DM:  clearing is on that side. But towards the east, the.

24:29 Gary the DM:  I guess the only other marker which is not that far away but a decent hike is the northern river.

24:38 Gary the DM:  So remember, Willow shore is kind of like at the mouth of like five rivers.

24:42 Gary the DM:  I kind of like that. And so there is a river to the east going northward and that might be

24:49 Gary the DM:  the, you know, the only other thing there.

24:51 Gary the DM:  But there's a river to the south as well, which you guys, you know, the Yangtze river, which is where

24:55 Gary the DM:  Willow Shore is. But I guess Dabashan and Boone, you see this glint of something metallic.

25:05 Gary the DM:  It's definitely, you know, something metallic that shined in the.

25:12 Gary the DM:  In that little pit there.

25:16 Chris as Boone:  All right, I get down, I peek over and take a look.

25:22 Gary the DM:  As you look down in there, like I said, it's not huge where it's like a, you know, thousand foot,

25:29 Gary the DM:  you know, cliff or anything like that.

25:30 Gary the DM:  It's a. It's a depression of a couple feet.

25:33 Gary the DM:  It. It appears fairly natural as you kind of look in there, you being a dwarf, it didn't look like

25:39 Gary the DM:  it's. You don't see a shovel marks or anything like that.

25:42 Gary the DM:  So. But it's pretty smooth, which maybe gives you a little bit of like, maybe it's unnatural.

25:50 Gary the DM:  But it wasn't dug in a way that you can see shovel marks or other types of things.

25:54 Gary the DM:  It's a very smooth like.

26:00 Gary the DM:  Oblong depression there. And there's a couple things in this little pit area.

26:07 Gary the DM:  The glitz piece looks like a knife, some, maybe a dagger is stuck into.

26:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The.

26:14 Gary the DM:  Earth in this little area. And that's what's kind of.

26:18 Gary the DM:  You're getting the glint of sunlight off of.

26:21 Gary the DM:  There's also looks like a bowl, like a clay pot in there.

26:25 Gary the DM:  And you're not exactly sure what is in there, but it seems like something is in the bowl.

26:30 Gary the DM:  The bowl isn't huge. It's like a pretty big cereal bowl, maybe like you might use for a soup bowl

26:35 Gary the DM:  or something. And that's in there.

26:39 Gary the DM:  And then there. It looks like there's something like maybe it's paper or something in the bowl.

26:44 Gary the DM:  There's definitely something there. But from where you see it, it's dark in there and you're not exactly sure what

26:48 Gary the DM:  it is. You see like paper, maybe something like that might be in the bowl.

26:56 Chris as Boone:  Okay, so this doesn't look like my wheelhouse exactly.

26:59 Chris as Boone:  So I'll yell up to the guys what's down here? Maybe, maybe some kind of ritual or something.

27:06 Chris as Boone:  You might want to check it out.

27:08 Chris as Boone:  And I'll just then keep an eye and scan out around us to kind of, you know, stand watch a

27:13 Chris as Boone:  little bit up above.

27:16 Gary the DM:  Okay, cool. So Boone tells the rest of the group about this.

27:23 Gary the DM:  I guess Donkey, were you going to do a detect magic or.

27:27 David as Donkey:  So I didn't have it prepared, but I do have spell substitution, so I can spend 10 minutes to swap

27:36 David as Donkey:  out one of my spell slots.

27:39 David as Donkey:  So I. I think I'm doing that while y' all are discovering the bowl.

27:44 Gary the DM:  Okay.

27:46 Chris as Boone:  Yes.

27:48 Gary the DM:  Geko, did you want to do any analysis of the mossy stuff? Okay.

27:54 Gary the DM:  That would be another nature check.

28:09 Gary the DM:  25. All right.

28:13 Gary the DM:  So Ginkgo, you get close to the moss and, you know, hey, being a fungus, you're probably pretty well versed

28:21 Gary the DM:  in its growth patterns. And I don't.

28:24 Gary the DM:  I don't know, maybe you can even talk to it.

28:27 Gary the DM:  This is not natural. It is definitely energized by something.

28:35 Gary the DM:  Something in the arcane area. You.

28:40 Gary the DM:  The way it grew. It looks like essentially like a blight, like some type of

28:50 Gary the DM:  arcane here blight that has affected this tree.

28:54 Gary the DM:  And is. He got a 25 most likely.

28:58 Gary the DM:  It's like

29:02 Gary the DM:  what you describe it as a bruise more so than anything else.

29:05 Gary the DM:  Like. Like it's not.

29:10 Gary the DM:  It's like. It's like getting the chicken pox or some type of, like, rash after an illness.

29:15 Gary the DM:  This. This isn't.

29:20 Gary the DM:  This isn't like a growth. That is the impetus.

29:23 Gary the DM:  It's like the after effect. This is what.

29:25 Gary the DM:  So that's kind of how you describe it.

29:26 Gary the DM:  And it's spread from this area.

29:28 Gary the DM:  So something must have happened in that area to the east, which is where that depression is.

29:35 Gary the DM:  And the after effect of that seemed to have caused this.

29:38 Gary the DM:  The energies used there seem to have caused this blight as like a rash or after effect to this mourn

29:46 Gary the DM:  dust tree.

29:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'd like to, like, pick up a rock and scrape a bit and see how the, like a bark looks

29:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  like beneath the.

29:55 Gary the DM:  Beneath it as you scrape a little bit, not much of it.

30:00 Gary the DM:  The bark underneath seems pretty normal.

30:02 Gary the DM:  Like it's not attacking the tree.

30:03 Gary the DM:  It seems like it's on surb there.

30:07 Gary the DM:  Like, there might be little, like, prawns in there, but it's not like, you know, viciously into the tree.

30:14 Gary the DM:  The bark there is a little bit more pale on the edges, but at least at this point, it doesn't

30:19 Gary the DM:  feel like it's infected the tree deeply.

30:22 Gary the DM:  From your. Your opinion. But when you did scrape it, you notice that the little lichens kind of spores, like,

30:29 Gary the DM:  kind of burst and kind of carried away in the wind a.

30:32 Chris as Boone:  Little bit.

30:34 Gary the DM:  As you were doing that.

30:36 Oded as Ginkgo:  Does it seem like it's coming from a specific spot on the tree? Like, can I trace some source or

30:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  anything?

30:46 Gary the DM:  I guess not on the tree, but it seems like something happened and infected that side of the tree which

30:53 Gary the DM:  caused Us to appear manifest. From what you kind of gathered with it know it's relatively recent because it hasn't

31:04 Gary the DM:  affected the tree very long, and it hasn't gotten around the tree or anything.

31:07 Gary the DM:  It is alive, so it will continue to spread.

31:11 Gary the DM:  But the cause of it and the energy that caused it seem to have been essentially like a very flash

31:18 Gary the DM:  of some type of blast of energy or something that happened close to the tree on the east side.

31:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can I tell if. If the tree is sad?

31:32 Gary the DM:  Sure, I guess. Give me a nature check.

31:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

31:35 Gary the DM:  It might be a high dc, but.

31:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm gonna add. I'm gonna add one to it with guidance.

31:47 Gary the DM:  Agree.

31:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

31:56 Gary the DM:  The tree is sad. The tree feels hurt.

32:05 Gary the DM:  I guess you. You pick up.

32:09 Gary the DM:  Maybe a better word might be battered.

32:11 Oded as Ginkgo:  Battered.

32:13 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

32:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. I just have something in my eye, guys, so.

32:20 Oded as Ginkgo:  Great.

32:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We need a tree lawyer.

32:28 Gary the DM:  The. So, Boone, you're standing guard.

32:33 Gary the DM:  And I guess Dabashan. Do you look in the depression there?

32:37 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Yeah, I'll look in as well.

32:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm curious.

32:40 Gary the DM:  You can reach down like it.

32:42 Gary the DM:  Like I said, it's a couple of feet.

32:43 Gary the DM:  So you could, like, as you lay across the roots, you could reach down and grab the things if you

32:47 Gary the DM:  want to, or you could just peer in before.

32:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think I'm just gonna peer in.

32:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm a little wary of the whole three in the whole area.

32:58 Gary the DM:  Okay. So what you see as you get really close to.

33:01 Gary the DM:  Kind of peer in without touching anything.

33:04 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

33:04 Gary the DM:  The earth there is smoothed out.

33:07 Gary the DM:  It's like a. Like a pool bottom.

33:11 Gary the DM:  Like, it's very smooth and earth and still dark earth.

33:18 Gary the DM:  But between these two roots, that kind of arc around this.

33:22 Gary the DM:  This kind of opening. And in the center of the opening, first you see the dagger, and it's stuck in

33:27 Gary the DM:  the center. And right above it, closer to the tree, is this bowl.

33:32 Gary the DM:  In the bowl, it's not paper.

33:34 Gary the DM:  What it looks like as you get close, I guess.

33:37 Gary the DM:  Give me a nature check. You need a.

33:40 Gary the DM:  You need a 15.

33:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is that me or is that anybody?

33:45 Gary the DM:  That'd be you. You're looking at his clothes.

33:47 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

33:47 Gary the DM:  No one else can see it close enough.

33:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, nature is not my forte.

33:55 Gary the DM:  You see something in there. It looks delicate, but you're not exactly sure what it.

34:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Standard practice when a kid comes on.

34:10 David as Donkey:  Zoom.

34:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Everybody wave.

34:14 Oded as Ginkgo:  What's up, Juni?

34:17 Gary the DM:  Can't hear you now, but so, yeah, you.

34:23 Gary the DM:  That. And that's all you see in that.

34:26 Gary the DM:  In that area so far is there's a goal.

34:30 Gary the DM:  There's something in the bowl. Looks like they're light, like leaves.

34:36 Gary the DM:  Maybe you're not Exactly, Sure. And then the dagger.

34:41 Gary the DM:  The dagger is a steel dagger arc, kind of curved blade with an ornate kind of handle.

34:49 Gary the DM:  Ceremonial kind of dagger from what you kind of see at it.

34:52 Gary the DM:  And it looks like the dagger has something on its blade, etched in its blade.

35:00 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm a little wary of disturbing what could be some kind of religious or spiritual, you know, ritual, but I

35:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  guess I will reach in and grab the bowl first.

35:17 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

35:18 Gary the DM:  Grab the bowl. Are you sure?

35:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Don't back out.

35:26 Gary the DM:  Do it, do it.

35:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Can I do it stealthily and see if I can.

35:31 Gary the DM:  You can do it slowly? Sure.

35:33 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And retrieve the bowl without disturbing the content just so I can get a closer look.

35:38 Gary the DM:  Do you grab the bowl? The bowl, as you touch it, nothing seems to happen.

35:42 Gary the DM:  It doesn't have any, like, weird.

35:44 Gary the DM:  It feels like a clay kind of, you know, pottery, ceramic, kind of edible.

35:51 Gary the DM:  You kind of grab, pull it out.

35:52 Gary the DM:  Doesn't feel any heavier than you would expect.

35:56 Gary the DM:  Nothing weird. As you get it, pull it out a little closer.

35:58 Gary the DM:  You get it into the light and pull it up.

36:00 Gary the DM:  And it's a non descript earthen kind of clay pot.

36:05 Gary the DM:  It's. It's a bowl. Doesn't seem to have much.

36:09 Gary the DM:  There's nothing written on it. It's a very round, smooth, ceramic kind of pot.

36:18 Gary the DM:  Not even glazed. It's. It's just kind of a rough kind of pot.

36:22 Gary the DM:  And in the bowl, now that you have it, you can take a closer look at it.

36:26 Gary the DM:  You find it's not leaves, it's not feathers.

36:31 Gary the DM:  It looks like insect wings. Butterfly, moth, something like that.

36:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll share that with the group and.

36:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And ask, should we disturb the day? Oh, God.

36:53 Gary the DM:  Out in the wood clearing nearby, on.

36:57 Gary the DM:  On the west side, the closer side, behind the tree, because you guys are on the east side.

37:01 Gary the DM:  You hear like the cracking of a.

37:04 Gary the DM:  Of a branch, like something heavy is stepped.

37:07 Gary the DM:  Or then there's a second or third one.

37:10 Gary the DM:  Your guard, boom, turns in that direction.

37:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  This is exactly what I was worried about.

37:16 David as Donkey:  Can we make it to the tree line? Can we hide?

37:19 Gary the DM:  You can. Out of the tree line comes some vicious squirrels.

37:27 David as Donkey:  Okay.

37:28 Gary the DM:  But not just normal squirrels, of course not.

37:32 Gary the DM:  Their skin, their fur is kind of, like molted a bit.

37:36 Gary the DM:  Like, it's. It's shaggy in different areas.

37:39 Gary the DM:  Their eyes are yellow as their angry fangs look at you.

37:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Do they appear undead or do they just appear.

37:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Appear diseased?

37:50 Gary the DM:  They. They appear diseased.

37:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay. Sorry. Ginkgo.

37:55 Oded as Ginkgo:  Do we see the, like a yellow lichen on them as well?

37:59 Chris as Boone:  You do.

38:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  Mm.

38:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  This is why we don't touch.

38:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We look with our eyes

38:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I was.

38:14 Gary the DM:  Gonna use this tree here, even though it's not really blackened, but as the black and willow there get you

38:24 Gary the DM:  guys.

38:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  On here, I mean as far as pre made maps go, that's pretty, pretty close.

38:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's good. That's cool.

38:38 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Well, I don't want to drop the bowl.

38:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That feels rude. So I'm just standing here holding a bowl of insect wings like I'm hungry.

38:53 Gary the DM:  Then let me see. I have my.

39:04 Gary the DM:  I couldn't find vicious looking squirrels which I thought I'd be able to find,

39:12 Gary the DM:  But so I'll use these vicious looking rats.

39:16 Gary the DM:  They found very cute pretty squirrels, but.

39:20 Gary the DM:  And I didn't feel like photoshopping them

39:24 Gary the DM:  so they come out and they're.

39:26 Gary the DM:  They're hissing and snarling and heading in your direction.

39:30 Gary the DM:  We'll need initiative.

39:33 Chris as Boone:  Did.

39:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Did the. Do we think the squirrels made the heavy cracking noise?

39:45 Gary the DM:  No, you don't.

39:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Great.

39:48 Gary the DM:  The heavy cracking noise, you realize comes out of the sideways not too far from the squirrels as a bear

39:56 Gary the DM:  seems to be infected by this sport.

40:00 Gary the DM:  This yellow lichens or whatever that is.

40:03 Gary the DM:  It's eyes of our yellow omi kind of mouth as it snarls in your direction.

40:08 Gary the DM:  And

40:13 Gary the DM:  we have three folks.

40:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Well, I'm not first probably because I have a bowl in my hands.

40:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  See, while Chris's daughter can't hear us, he can hear us.

40:35 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So we can say the most vile to not react.

40:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  This is why I advise everyone who reports to me to have headphones on if they have kids around.

40:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Cuz I have no filter.

40:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  You guys will appreciate that. Someone asked me recently where did like, you know? Because I swear at work.

41:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And someone was like, I never swear at work.

41:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like how'd you get comfortable with that? I was like, did you know Jess Wood?

41:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They didn't have that joke. Didn't work for them, but it works for some of y'.

41:19 Chris as Boone:  All. What is that amazing thing in David's on David screen there?

41:27 David as Donkey:  That is bitty.

41:29 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

41:32 David as Donkey:  She's trying to get comfortable on another laptop that I have sitting on my desk.

41:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Our cats don't climb on counters or desks or they're very un cat like in that regard.

41:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They don't climb up and get in view.

41:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The bird does, but he sleeps.

41:58 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

41:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Chris will never get to meet the bird because dnd's past the bird's bedtime.

42:05 Chris as Boone:  What kind of bird is it?

42:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  He's a little cockatiel.

42:08 Chris as Boone:  He's.

42:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  He's not very big, but his name's A L and he is the superstar for all my meetings because he

42:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  sits on my shoulder all day when I work.

42:19 Chris as Boone:  Awesome.

42:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I've done interview with him on my shoulder, and that's always a trip.

42:26 Gary the DM:  So Boone's first, and then Ginkgo, your second.

42:34 Gary the DM:  And then it's actually the. The infected bear would be third.

42:39 Gary the DM:  We got for the top three.

42:40 Chris as Boone:  There we go.

42:41 Gary the DM:  So, yeah, it comes out to crowd or as it reaches out other things making a ruckus as it's the

42:47 Gary the DM:  one that cracked all the twigs nearby.

42:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I shouldn't have asked. I should have pretended like that didn't happen again.

43:00 Gary the DM:  I was trying to do a surprise.

43:02 David as Donkey:  That's right.

43:03 Gary the DM:  I guess. I guess I've done that before.

43:05 Gary the DM:  I need to come up with new techniques.

43:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Investigator.

43:11 Chris as Boone:  So let's see. And they look.

43:14 Chris as Boone:  I mean, these look hostile. There's no question.

43:16 Chris as Boone:  Like, this is not a friendly bear, right?

43:19 Gary the DM:  They're not. They are not friendly at all.

43:21 Chris as Boone:  Okay, great. I'm gonna.

43:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm gonna chop.

43:24 Gary the DM:  You don't need a roll for that.

43:26 Chris as Boone:  I'm gonna chop the bear.

43:31 Chris as Boone:  Let's.

43:42 Oded as Ginkgo:  Where is the willow on the map?

43:46 Gary the DM:  It's the center. The center tree, actually.

43:50 Gary the DM:  I'll do this. I'll put a black box on it.

43:54 Chris as Boone:  Long sword. 27 to hit.

43:59 David as Donkey:  Who?

44:01 Gary the DM:  So that's the black willow, that black box there.

44:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yep.

44:06 Gary the DM:  27 to hit. I believe that's a hit.

44:09 Chris as Boone:  Is that by any chance 10 more than.

44:10 Chris as Boone:  It's A.C.

44:14 Gary the DM:  No. Close, though.

44:16 Chris as Boone:  Oh, man. Okay. All right.

44:18 Gary the DM:  So, yeah, we have to remember that.

44:19 Gary the DM:  Yeah, 10 more is a triple.

44:27 Chris as Boone:  7. 7 damage on the bear.

44:30 Chris as Boone:  Damage.

44:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

44:31 Chris as Boone:  And.

44:37 Chris as Boone:  I think I will raise my shield for my third action here.

44:41 Chris as Boone:  So AC Comes up to.

44:53 Gary the DM:  So you run up, slice the.

44:56 Gary the DM:  The bear across its shoulder as.

45:01 Gary the DM:  And then you raise your shield.

45:02 Gary the DM:  When you slice into it, this yellow spores kind of explode out.

45:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, God, I hope it's not infection.

45:17 Gary the DM:  I need you to make a fortitude save.

45:20 Chris as Boone:  Oh, yeah, first save. Okay, 22.

45:28 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

45:28 Gary the DM:  22. So kind of, you know, gets out in the air, streams around you a little bit.

45:33 Chris as Boone:  You.

45:36 Gary the DM:  Notice that, you know, as you breathe them in, there's a kind of a sulfury burning kind of feeling in

45:42 Gary the DM:  your nose. But just hold your breath pretty quickly.

45:44 Gary the DM:  And so nothing adverse happens. But you know from that encounter that

45:53 Gary the DM:  it won't be

45:57 Gary the DM:  It. Yeah, there's some adverse effects by these spores.

46:01 Gary the DM:  They aren't benign at all.

46:05 Chris as Boone:  All.

46:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Ginkgo.

46:13 Gary the DM:  Ginkgo's second.

46:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. Ginkgo is. Is not happy with infected animals.

46:21 Oded as Ginkgo:  Does not like that at all.

46:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  Doesn't shy away from defending ourselves.

46:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  But ginkgo wants to do everything he can to save the animals.

46:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  So he's gonna pull out his healer's toolkit and see if we can concoct something and try it out on

46:40 Oded as Ginkgo:  the willow to see how the Lycan responds to it.

46:45 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can I do that?

46:45 Gary the DM:  Okay, sure. You can craft something.

46:49 Gary the DM:  Give me a. It'll take all three of your actions.

46:55 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'll do it.

46:56 Gary the DM:  Okay, so give me a.

47:02 Gary the DM:  Want to use medicine or. Or nature?

47:05 Oded as Ginkgo:  It doesn't matter.

47:07 Gary the DM:  I think technically it'd be a medicine check.

47:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  So medicine.

47:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

47:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  There is a craft skill, apparently, as well.

47:20 Gary the DM:  Yeah. So craft is. Craft is kind of a.

47:23 Gary the DM:  They have several skills, are kind of like these basic universal skills, and then it depends what you craft, the

47:30 Gary the DM:  attribute or thing that it's linked to.

47:32 Gary the DM:  So, hey, if you're an alchemist, and typically you have to have a craft feet, so, like, craft alchemy or

47:41 Gary the DM:  craft potion, craft scroll. But with medicine, that's.

47:46 Gary the DM:  They have, like. Medicine has, like, treat, poison, and other things, so it feels like you can craft stuff with

47:51 Gary the DM:  it. And there's no, like, medicine crafting, so I guess technically it's alchemical, but anyway, I'm letting it go.

47:59 Gary the DM:  With healers, there's not a lot of healing opportunities in this game like DND did.

48:05 Gary the DM:  But. So, anyway, I'm sorry.

48:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  What's your own 21?

48:09 Gary the DM:  Did you get a 20? Oh, you did.

48:13 Chris as Boone:  All right.

48:17 Gary the DM:  So you reach into your medicine kit and pull out a few things, and I would say you.

48:28 Gary the DM:  You root.

48:34 Gary the DM:  Guardians of the galaxy, you actually take a piece of yourself.

48:38 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

48:40 Gary the DM:  And pull that and mix that, and it creates, like, a paste you're molding.

48:45 Gary the DM:  It's like a salve. And when you put it on the.

48:48 Gary the DM:  The tree in that space and rub it off, the.

48:50 Gary the DM:  Like, the lichens are no longer yellow.

48:53 Gary the DM:  The bright yellow or mustardy yellow that they were.

48:56 Gary the DM:  They're a grayish color, and they just kind of slide off.

49:00 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I'm gonna yell to Boone, please don't kill it.

49:06 Oded as Ginkgo:  Please. Just incapacitated, but please don't kill it.

49:11 Chris as Boone:  And V just looks over from behind the shield, like, are you serious?

49:18 Chris as Boone:  All right.

49:19 Gary the DM:  And lucky for Boone, the. The angry bear is the next one to attack.

49:26 Gary the DM:  So he attacks. He swings its massive paw initially as boon 28.

49:36 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, and that's 10 more than my current AC, so that's a critical.

49:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Hey, bear, don't kill. Boone.

49:51 Gary the DM:  Did nine points of slashing damage to you.

49:55 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

49:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We should have healed Boone up a little better.

49:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Maybe.

50:02 Gary the DM:  The force of it knocks you down.

50:05 Gary the DM:  You're essentially grabbed by the bear.

50:08 Gary the DM:  The bear's on top of you.

50:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  Now.

50:12 Gary the DM:  So you are. You have the restrained condition, if you want to find that and that.

50:17 Gary the DM:  Remember that little conditions box.

50:21 Chris as Boone:  Let's see. I've got the character sheet up, and I know conditions.

50:23 Gary the DM:  It's like, in that somewhere. Row above your skills.

50:26 Gary the DM:  Like the third one over, I think.

50:28 Gary the DM:  Third box over.

50:30 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yep.

50:30 Gary the DM:  And there's like that. I think it's empty.

50:32 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. Restrained.

50:39 Chris as Boone:  All right.

50:41 Gary the DM:  Creature has you pinned your. Immobilized and off guard.

50:43 Gary the DM:  Off guard, basically, is like a flanking.

50:46 Gary the DM:  It's a. Lowers your armor class by two.

50:49 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. And it automatically put up.

50:50 Chris as Boone:  Restrained, off guard. Immobilized and it automatically.

50:53 Gary the DM:  That's what I was looking like.

50:54 Gary the DM:  It does a really good job so far.

50:56 Gary the DM:  Like all these condition stuff. So, like I tell you restrain.

50:58 Gary the DM:  And it tells you all this stuff that it's affected by.

51:02 Gary the DM:  And then its final move is to bite you as it has you pinned down.

51:08 Gary the DM:  You see its mouth and saliva is, like, right on the edge of your shield.

51:13 Gary the DM:  And pull. Pull this head back.

51:15 Gary the DM:  And then lunges at your face.

51:17 Gary the DM:  But you're able to get your shield up in time as a golden 11.

51:21 Gary the DM:  So, okay, so this. Claw marks hit your shield.

51:28 Gary the DM:  You had your shield up too, right? So I did.

51:34 Gary the DM:  We are at.

51:39 Gary the DM:  And then. Donkey, you're up.

51:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  After that, I. I heard Ginkgo say, don't.

51:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Don't hurt the bear, but my investigator instincts tell me that that's not going to go well.

51:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'm gonna take a shot at it with my crossbow.

51:58 Oded as Ginkgo:  You can. You could hurt it.

52:00 Oded as Ginkgo:  Just don't kill it.

52:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, well, I'm probably gonna do neither.

52:07 Gary the DM:  Into the wood somewhere.

52:10 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

52:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So far, this crossbow has. Has been letting me down every time.

52:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'll use another action to reload it, because.

52:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Glutton for punishment. And then my third.

52:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No, my third act. I will.

52:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll use my apothecary or my alchemist toolkit and see if I can assist.

52:36 Gary the DM:  Oh, okay, so you're gonna assist Ginkgo.

52:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, See if anything in my kid will help him make his salve in higher quantities.

52:47 Gary the DM:  Okay, I'll tell you what. Roll.

52:54 Gary the DM:  Let's see. I was gonna say.

53:02 Gary the DM:  Roll. Crafting skill.

53:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Shouldn't have brought that one up.

53:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm not trained in that one.

53:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay, 21.

53:12 Gary the DM:  All right, so you saw what he did.

53:16 Gary the DM:  And you get out of.

53:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  A little.

53:24 Gary the DM:  Not glass vial, but a skinned leather kind of pouch that you'd use for, like, ale or wine or something

53:32 Gary the DM:  like a wine skin. But it's.

53:33 Gary the DM:  But it's smaller for, like, alchemical type of things.

53:36 Gary the DM:  And you mix up some Sav pretty quickly.

53:40 Gary the DM:  And you ask Gekko to add his ingredients.

53:43 Gary the DM:  This could be bad. His special sauce.

53:48 Gary the DM:  How much do you need?

53:53 Gary the DM:  You don't want to know how he gets it, but it's in there.

53:58 Gary the DM:  And so you have. After this round, you'll be able to use it.

54:03 Gary the DM:  Next round, you have essentially a.

54:05 Gary the DM:  A sav bomb that you can use to throw.

54:11 Gary the DM:  It won't have a huge range, but it could be effective where you don't have to get up to the

54:18 Gary the DM:  creature and actually rub it. The sam on them.

54:21 Gary the DM:  So.

54:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Great.

54:26 Gary the DM:  All right, we are. Let's see, at 5.

54:28 Gary the DM:  Donkey.

54:31 David as Donkey:  Okay, so I have a plan.

54:34 David as Donkey:  Can I use an action to get some of the salve from either daibachan or ginkgo?

54:41 Gary the DM:  Yeah. So you can use it.

54:42 Gary the DM:  I'll call it. There's an interact action.

54:45 Gary the DM:  They're near you, so I'll say, wait, how close are you? Yeah, you're within five.

54:52 Gary the DM:  So you can use one of your actions to interact and get stuff from that set.

54:55 Gary the DM:  Yep.

54:56 David as Donkey:  Okay, so will one of you give me some?

55:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. How's your pitching arm, old man?

55:04 David as Donkey:  Well, so the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold the salve in one hand and cast hydraulic

55:11 David as Donkey:  push with the other hand on the bear.

55:14 Gary the DM:  Okay.

55:15 David as Donkey:  I'm gonna try and spray him with the salve.

55:18 Gary the DM:  Okay.

55:19 David as Donkey:  And hopefully knock him off a boom.

55:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

55:26 Gary the DM:  Is that like a, say, saving throw or.

55:38 Gary the DM:  Or is an attack.

55:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So they're.

55:40 David as Donkey:  It's. Yeah. So their defense is their ac.

55:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

55:43 David as Donkey:  Yep.

55:45 Gary the DM:  Roll your spell attack.

55:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So.

55:54 Gary the DM:  The sav. And this. I don't know.

55:57 Gary the DM:  What. What does your hydraulic push look like? Is it just wind? Is it.

56:01 Gary the DM:  Do you manifest leaves? What's the.

56:06 David as Donkey:  So I think it just.

56:08 Gary the DM:  Whatever's in your hand.

56:10 David as Donkey:  It says it's a blast of pressurized water.

56:13 Gary the DM:  Okay.

56:16 David as Donkey:  And I think it's. So it's like a.

56:18 David as Donkey:  A focused stream. Like, I'm not necessarily trying to hurt the bear.

56:23 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

56:23 David as Donkey:  Although it is a blast, and it does, you know, come at a fairly high rate.

56:29 Gary the DM:  Okay.

56:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Based on what the salve is, the imagery on this hydraulic bush is.

56:33 David as Donkey:  It's getting.

56:34 Gary the DM:  It's getting bad. Yeah. So the.

56:39 Gary the DM:  The white salve is ejected toward the bear.

56:44 Gary the DM:  So this ocean of water, if that's how you describe it, goes streaking out towards you.

56:50 Gary the DM:  Boom. You see it go over the bear and passes as you.

56:54 Gary the DM:  You hear this rushing, you know, geyser kind of sound of rushing water from streaking past the bear, which did

57:03 Gary the DM:  not hit him, unfortunately.

57:08 David as Donkey:  That's all my moves.

57:09 Gary the DM:  I'm helping and Then we have the squirrels.

57:30 Gary the DM:  All right.

57:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I wonder who that one squirrel is going to attack.

57:39 Gary the DM:  One gets an attack on. When you're laying down kind of fighting off this bear, you hear the this of

57:49 Gary the DM:  the squirrel as you're able to roll your shoulder and bites at you and misses.

57:54 Gary the DM:  Because no more bite attack. Oh, totally misses.

57:57 Gary the DM:  So it snaps at you twice as you're rolling back and forth, avoiding its jaws.

58:02 Gary the DM:  The bear above you saying, please be more accurate to your rest of your crew who have missed everything that

58:09 Gary the DM:  they tried to do. The other squirrel rushes in and leaps at.

58:17 Gary the DM:  This would be Donkey.

58:25 Gary the DM:  14. I don't think that hits.

58:28 David as Donkey:  My armor class is 14.

58:29 Gary the DM:  Okay, so that hits.

58:39 Gary the DM:  I need a fortitude saving throw from donkey.

58:49 Gary the DM:  Two points of piercing damage were done to you, Donkey.

58:58 Gary the DM:  Oh, here we go.

59:03 Gary the DM:  All right, we are at. Let's see.

59:08 David as Donkey:  Boom.

59:09 Gary the DM:  You're up.

59:10 Chris as Boone:  All right. I have one thing I can do, and it's the escape action, I think.

59:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yep.

59:17 Chris as Boone:  So when I've just been reading up on that.

59:19 Chris as Boone:  So I'm going to use my unarmed attack modifier, which is plus 9, and just try to punch the bear

59:24 Chris as Boone:  off me. And it's against his athletics DC so 10 his athletics modifier, whatever that is.

59:31 Chris as Boone:  I'm sure it's huge. So here we go.

59:34 Chris as Boone:  Oh, 14.

59:36 Gary the DM:  Yes. You slug this bear and try to push it, shove it off you.

59:40 Gary the DM:  Does not seem to make much of an effect.

59:43 Gary the DM:  Is that how many escape is how many actions? Is that two or one?

59:47 Chris as Boone:  It's one action. Let me double check and make sure.

59:52 Chris as Boone:  I mean, I think maybe I don't know if I could try again, but I'm not sure.

59:54 Chris as Boone:  Let me try again if I'm able to.

60:00 Gary the DM:  Attack action.

60:01 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

60:02 Gary the DM:  So.

60:02 Chris as Boone:  So it would be the. The multiple attack penalty if I try it, which I'll definitely try it again anyway.

60:10 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. Okay. So I can just keep trying, but it gets harder each time.

60:13 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

60:13 Gary the DM:  So you get.

60:15 Chris as Boone:  Let's do it. Okay. I have no other option.

60:20 Gary the DM:  This 11. All right, so you're still slugging at it.

60:26 Gary the DM:  Nothing. Get your third to try.

60:29 Chris as Boone:  Third try.

60:30 Gary the DM:  He rolled high.

60:33 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. Three.

60:35 Gary the DM:  All right, so you're three shoves and punches rolls trying to get off.

60:41 Gary the DM:  Provided you no clearance as the bear is still on top of you.

60:45 Gary the DM:  And we have.

60:53 Gary the DM:  Eco. You're up. And then.

61:00 Gary the DM:  Then the bear. Yep. Got it.

61:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  What? Can you explain what happens again when the head points reach zero?

61:10 Gary the DM:  You're. You go to death saves, basically.

61:16 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. And you have.

61:20 Gary the DM:  But it's a little bit different.

61:21 Oded as Ginkgo:  And you need to, like, if you have a few rows in Death saves.

61:26 Gary the DM:  Yeah, yeah.

61:28 Chris as Boone:  Of.

61:28 Gary the DM:  Unless he's wounded, he has four, basically.

61:32 Gary the DM:  So he gets to. And it's a natural role like DD had.

61:37 Gary the DM:  So 10 or higher, it's a success.

61:40 Gary the DM:  Or 11 or higher success. One to not one to 10, it's a failure.

61:44 Gary the DM:  And if you get enough those failures, you die.

61:48 Gary the DM:  And then attacks that are successful against him automatically give a failure.

61:54 Gary the DM:  If it's a critical, it automatically gives two failures.

61:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I guess I won't risk it.

62:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm gonna cast heal using two actions, which, if I understand correctly, gives eight hit points plus one D8.

62:16 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, so that's 11 hit points total for Boom.

62:24 Chris as Boone:  Thank you.

62:25 Gary the DM:  What do you. What do you do when you cast cure? Do you.

62:28 Gary the DM:  Do you, like, blow flowers at them? Is it like little bugs?

62:34 Oded as Ginkgo:  Well, I. My thing is I communicate with the mycelium in the ground, so I like.

62:40 Oded as Ginkgo:  I put my hands on the ground, and then the mycelium comes out around boon and helps patch up some

62:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  wounds.

62:50 Gary the DM:  Very cool. So you feel this warmth in your back, I guess, as your wounds start healing up.

62:58 Oded as Ginkgo:  And with my last action, I'm gonna make some more salve.

63:03 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

63:06 Oded as Ginkgo:  Do I need to roll anything for that?

63:08 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I guess we're in combat, so stressful situation, at least.

63:13 Gary the DM:  Roll medicine.

63:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Check.

63:14 Gary the DM:  You'll need a 10 or higher.

63:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

63:22 Gary the DM:  All right.

63:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's quite a good refractory period to craft.

63:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  More sobs so quickly.

63:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  All natural, baby.

63:32 Gary the DM:  All right, so we're at the bear.

63:37 Gary the DM:  Boon, unfortunately, is taking the brunt of this bears attack.

63:45 Gary the DM:  It takes another claw attack and then two bites.

63:52 Gary the DM:  19.

63:54 Chris as Boone:  Yep.

64:01 Gary the DM:  That's nine points of damage.

64:12 Gary the DM:  A bite is 15.

64:16 Chris as Boone:  Okay, that puts me at negative four.

64:20 Gary the DM:  Did 15 hit you?

64:22 Chris as Boone:  Oh, no. 15 does not hit me out.

64:24 Chris as Boone:  Sorry. I was thinking 15 damage.

64:26 Gary the DM:  Sorry. Yeah. So that the claw hits you, he's able to scrape along your.

64:31 Gary the DM:  Your arm and shoulder. Outside of your shield is it reaches down to bite you again and misses.

64:37 Gary the DM:  You're able to get your shield in the way.

64:39 Gary the DM:  Oh, the second bite, though. This is a 24.

64:43 Gary the DM:  That's a hit.

64:49 Gary the DM:  Oh, he rolled a one. You're lucky.

64:52 Gary the DM:  So six points of damage.

64:56 Chris as Boone:  Okay, I'm hanging on.

65:02 David as Donkey:  Does you.

65:02 Gary the DM:  You guys see this bite kind of come down near the neck of.

65:05 Gary the DM:  Of Boone as he yells out blood.

65:08 Gary the DM:  As he pulled his mouth away, blood kind of arcs in the.

65:13 Gary the DM:  In the air after him and get.

65:18 Chris as Boone:  The spare off me.

65:20 Gary the DM:  Sean, you're up.

65:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  With my first action. Can I interact with ginkgo to grab some of the salve he made? And then I'd

65:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  like to rub that onto My crossbow bolt that I've got loaded.

65:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  Nice.

65:38 Gary the DM:  Sure. Let's interact. Yeah. So that'll be two interactions.

65:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay, I will do that, and then I will use my last action to take a shot at the bear.

65:49 Gary the DM:  All right. Cross your fingers. Here we go.

65:52 Gary the DM:  Diverse shine of the crossbow.

65:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Only a 10.

65:58 Gary the DM:  Another arrow goes deep into the woods.

66:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I need a different weapon. This damn crossbow.

66:10 Gary the DM:  The staff probably caused it to be erratic.

66:14 Gary the DM:  That's probably what you're thinking. It wasn't.

66:16 Gary the DM:  It wasn't your aim for sure.

66:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It couldn't be. Orcs have great aim.

66:20 Gary the DM:  Yeah. The sun was in your eyes.

66:25 Gary the DM:  All right, we're at. Donkey, you're up.

66:31 David as Donkey:  All right, I am gonna cast tangle vines on the bear.

66:38 Gary the DM:  Okay. All right, I think that was a save.

66:44 Gary the DM:  Wasn't. I need the. That's the one thing I miss about the DD beyond had a great.

66:49 Gary the DM:  And for my spell.

66:51 David as Donkey:  Oh.

66:55 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

66:56 David as Donkey:  Come on.

66:58 Gary the DM:  That one. Is it an attack roll?

67:00 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, yeah, we're trying.

67:03 Gary the DM:  So vines kind of streak up around him.

67:07 Gary the DM:  They seem to grab things, but unfortunately, without great control of your tangle vines today, they seem to wrap around,

67:14 Gary the DM:  like, trees and other elements around the bear and never really entangle them enough to restrict him.

67:26 Gary the DM:  Let's see. The one rat.

67:33 Gary the DM:  Attacks. Boon with a claw. That's 14.

67:40 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. Boone shrugs off the tiny rat claw.

67:43 Chris as Boone:  Just scrapes along a piece of armor or something.

67:46 Gary the DM:  Nice. And then this one is also 14.

67:51 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, same. All right.

67:55 Gary the DM:  And let's see. It'll. It doesn't really have much to do for its third.

67:58 Gary the DM:  I guess I can do another attack this third act.

68:00 Gary the DM:  Oh, wait. These guys only get two.

68:02 Chris as Boone:  All right.

68:08 Gary the DM:  Right. All right, so the rat thingy.

68:13 Gary the DM:  Or squirrel. Sorry. Attacks Donkey.

68:23 Gary the DM:  That's a 17.

68:26 David as Donkey:  That hits.

68:28 Gary the DM:  And then a 15.

68:30 David as Donkey:  Those both hit.

68:31 Gary the DM:  Okay. Donkey gets bit twice. I'll need two Fortitude saving throws.

68:43 Gary the DM:  And all together, it did eight points of damage.

68:45 Gary the DM:  Piercing damage to you. All right.

68:48 Gary the DM:  And fortunate saving throws seem good.

68:54 David as Donkey:  Boone's over here fighting a rat and a bear, and I'm getting taken down by one rat.

69:00 Gary the DM:  It's a squirrel.

69:01 David as Donkey:  A squirrel.

69:02 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

69:03 Gary the DM:  It's even better. All right, Boone, you're back.

69:08 Chris as Boone:  Okay, so I've got the escape option.

69:11 Chris as Boone:  It's, I think, my only option, so I'll do my.

69:15 Gary the DM:  Oh, you got a chance this time.

69:17 Chris as Boone:  Do my unarmed attack again.

69:26 Chris as Boone:  Oh, yeah, that was a two on the dice.

69:29 Chris as Boone:  So, okay, 11.

69:30 Gary the DM:  You kind of slid out a little bit, but he was able to pull you under.

69:33 Gary the DM:  You needed a 13 that time.

69:35 Chris as Boone:  Okay, I'm gonna try it again.

69:37 Chris as Boone:  I get a plus five on the second attempt.

69:41 Chris as Boone:  Oh, a 10.

69:43 Gary the DM:  Now, he's still got the pin down.

69:45 Gary the DM:  He's got his weight on you.

69:48 Chris as Boone:  There's no reason not to attempt the third.

69:50 Chris as Boone:  All the critical failure does keep me from attempting another one.

69:53 Chris as Boone:  So 10 again.

69:57 Gary the DM:  No. You struggle against this bear.

70:00 Gary the DM:  He's got all of his weight on you.

70:03 Gary the DM:  Howling. You could smell his nasty breath.

70:06 Gary the DM:  Been fighting off these biting claw marks on him.

70:10 Gary the DM:  We are at ginkgo.

70:12 Chris as Boone:  I. I do yell at the guys.

70:13 Chris as Boone:  Like, I know you don't want to hurt the bear, but maybe hurt the bear.

70:18 Oded as Ginkgo:  No, no, we can hurt the bear.

70:19 Oded as Ginkgo:  That's okay. Let's hurt the bear.

70:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm going to cast fear on the bear.

70:29 Gary the DM:  Okay.

70:33 Oded as Ginkgo:  So it needs to do a will save against.

70:37 Gary the DM:  Okay. Willpower will say barry.

70:41 Chris as Boone:  All right.

70:41 Gary the DM:  11.

70:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  How do I know? Like what?

70:45 Gary the DM:  You should have a spell. DC spelled craft.

70:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  So the DC is a 17.

70:52 Oded as Ginkgo:  So the bear is now frightened 2, which means that it gets minus 2 on.

70:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  On every roll and on every save and on.

71:05 Oded as Ginkgo:  On the AC as well. So it should be easier to hit as well.

71:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So.

71:10 Gary the DM:  Got it right into. He's got.

71:13 Gary the DM:  Did he? Okay. Does something happen on a critical failure?

71:17 Oded as Ginkgo:  A critical failure is frightened three and fleeing for one round.

71:23 Gary the DM:  I got you.

71:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

71:24 Gary the DM:  I was wondering. I thought something had to flee.

71:25 Gary the DM:  Okay, he's got two. All right.

71:30 Gary the DM:  And he's got minus two on his saves on his attack rolls and

71:39 Gary the DM:  all checks. And DC's okay.

71:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  And. And AC.

71:43 Gary the DM:  Yep, got it.

71:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  And I. I'll use the last action to again, make some more self just in case.

71:50 Gary the DM:  Okay.

71:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We'Re going through it.

71:57 Oded as Ginkgo:  That's all right.

71:57 Gary the DM:  The bear attacks. I bet you guys minus twos.

72:06 Gary the DM:  Oh, no.

72:13 Gary the DM:  It's 27 on the claw to hit.

72:17 Chris as Boone:  That's a critical hit.

72:19 Oded as Ginkgo:  Is. Is that after the minus two?

72:21 Gary the DM:  Yeah, I rolled a 20.

72:29 Gary the DM:  All right.

72:36 Gary the DM:  12 points of slashing damage.

72:41 Chris as Boone:  And do I even worry about negative, or do I just go to zero and then we'll do.

72:45 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you go to zero.

72:46 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

72:47 Gary the DM:  You see the last claw streaks across Boone's chest as he was initially fighting off the squirrel above him or

72:56 Gary the DM:  near his head and gets hit by the bear.

73:00 Gary the DM:  And his shield that he was fighting him off with goes limp down.

73:05 Gary the DM:  His sword is down by his side.

73:08 Gary the DM:  Then the bear looks up. So that was his first attack.

73:11 Gary the DM:  And then he sneers at the group, and he's prince toward boon.

73:19 Gary the DM:  No, sorry, not off of boon.

73:21 Oded as Ginkgo:  Sorry.

73:21 Gary the DM:  Toward donkey. And we'll make a claw attack at donkey.

73:35 Gary the DM:  16.

73:38 David as Donkey:  That hits.

73:43 Gary the DM:  Eight points of slashing damage.

73:46 David as Donkey:  Yep, I'm down.

73:49 Chris as Boone:  Oh, no.

73:53 Chris as Boone:  Little Finger wanders back to four corpses.

74:02 Gary the DM:  So see, we're at Baban.

74:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Well,

74:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I will use an action to move in close to the bear.

74:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let's see. Can I flank the bear? Well, I wouldn't get flanking because Boone's down, right?

74:24 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

74:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right, I'll just move in closer to the bear then.

74:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm giving up on the crossbow.

74:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm gonna. I'll draw my short sword and take a swing with that.

74:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  19.

74:40 Gary the DM:  19'S a hit on the bear.

74:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Thank.

74:44 Gary the DM:  It's got minus two.

74:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  What said thank? All right, that's three damage.

74:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And then. So if I have my short sword in my primary hand and my dagger in my offhand, does

75:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  that. Do I get a penalty by doing the second attack with the dagger? Yes, Bill.

75:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

75:13 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

75:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right, then I won't use the dagger then.

75:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll just do. I'll attack with the short sword again for my last action.

75:23 Chris as Boone:  15.

75:24 Gary the DM:  15'S a hit.

75:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, thank God.

75:27 Gary the DM:  You get the minus two so far.

75:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Five more damage. All right.

75:37 Gary the DM:  Bear is still alive. Donkey's up.

75:43 Gary the DM:  Let's see. Donkey, I think you have to make a save.

75:45 Gary the DM:  I think you just roll a D20.

75:51 Gary the DM:  If you ever get above zero hit points, you gets consciousness.

75:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Yep.

76:01 Gary the DM:  All right, so you have. You have one success.

76:04 Gary the DM:  So you're. You're.

76:13 Gary the DM:  I think you. You're back to you have one hit point right now.

76:20 David as Donkey:  Oh, with one success.

76:22 Chris as Boone:  Yep.

76:23 Gary the DM:  You have the wounded condition one, though.

76:33 Oded as Ginkgo:  So.

76:34 Gary the DM:  Wounded condition, you start closer to death if you were to get back to zero hit points.

76:42 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

76:45 David as Donkey:  Is there a way to track conditions in here, or do I just need to remember?

76:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, here we go. Habit.

76:57 David as Donkey:  I think.

77:06 Gary the DM:  That's all you can do.

77:17 Gary the DM:  Run the rats. Let's see.

77:26 Gary the DM:  That one moves in there.

77:33 Gary the DM:  Because they only get two actions instead of three.

77:37 Gary the DM:  So the one bites at Ginko and misses, the other one moves in on Dai Bashan.

77:43 Gary the DM:  And that's just because he used both his actions to move.

77:47 Gary the DM:  And now we're at Boom. You do the same dying roll.

77:52 Chris as Boone:  Okay, so just a D20.

77:54 Gary the DM:  Just a natural D20. Yeah.

77:55 Chris as Boone:  All right.

78:04 Gary the DM:  All right, so you're. You're dying level two.

78:07 Gary the DM:  Now you're closer to that.

78:12 Chris as Boone:  All right.

78:14 Gary the DM:  And we are at. Get go.

78:16 Gary the DM:  You're up.

78:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  Am I close enough to touch Donkey if I reach?

78:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No.

78:34 Gary the DM:  And that's attached. We can move.

78:36 Gary the DM:  So that's the other thing in this game.

78:40 Gary the DM:  Not there. You know, attack of opportunity is not universal.

78:47 Gary the DM:  So you can move around and certain creatures and certain, you know, adversaries may or may not have it, and

78:56 Gary the DM:  you Guys don't have it either.

78:58 Gary the DM:  Fighters can get it and other, like, martial combatants can, but.

79:05 Gary the DM:  So if you're worried about, like an attack opportunity on you, you don't have to worry about that as much

79:09 Gary the DM:  here. Certain creatures do have it, but like I said, others don't.

79:14 Gary the DM:  And you could do a nature check to get some insight into this thing.

79:18 Gary the DM:  These things to what they can't.

79:20 Gary the DM:  Can't do. But.

79:22 Oded as Ginkgo:  And. But any move, no matter how far, is an action.

79:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yep.

79:29 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

79:30 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can move up to your.

79:34 Gary the DM:  It's called a stride action. And you can move up to your movement as a stride action.

79:39 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

79:40 Gary the DM:  Unless you're climbing.

79:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

79:42 Gary the DM:  And then.

79:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'll. I'm gonna cast stabilize on Boon.

79:50 Gary the DM:  Okay.

79:51 Oded as Ginkgo:  The target loses the dying condition, though it remains unconscious.

79:58 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can he get back to consciousness somehow with a roam? How does that work?

80:08 Gary the DM:  I guess. Does that mean Donkey, I guess, should have been at zero and unconscious.

80:14 Gary the DM:  If you're successful, you lose. Let's see,

80:19 Gary the DM:  that was reduced by one. Anytime you lose the dying condition, you increase your moon value.

80:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  1.

80:28 Gary the DM:  I guess you're.

80:38 Gary the DM:  Okay. So I guess Donkey is still unconscious, but you're no longer dying.

80:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  And what about the heel? Like with a heel.

80:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  Bring them?

80:48 Chris as Boone:  Yep.

80:48 Gary the DM:  Heal. Anytime you heal to get.

80:51 Gary the DM:  As soon as they get off the zero hit points, they'll be conscious again.

80:55 Gary the DM:  Okay, so Donkey's at zero hit points.

80:58 Gary the DM:  Boo's at zero hit points. But not dying.

81:02 Gary the DM:  Knocked out for.

81:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  I have one.

81:04 David as Donkey:  Am I still dying?

81:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  One.

81:08 David as Donkey:  Because I succeeded the roll.

81:11 Chris as Boone:  No, you.

81:12 Gary the DM:  You're not dying.

81:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

81:14 Gary the DM:  But you're. You're not conscious. You're unconscious.

81:18 Gary the DM:  Gotcha.

81:20 Oded as Ginkgo:  I can cast heal using three actions, which heals all living things.

81:30 Oded as Ginkgo:  Does that mean it will heal the bear as.

81:36 Gary the DM:  What did it say?

81:39 Oded as Ginkgo:  It says you disperse vital energy in 30 foot.

81:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  This target targets all living and undead creatures in the burst.

81:50 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yep.

81:57 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I'm going to cast heal using two actions on.

82:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  On boon. That would be eight hit points plus one D8.

82:13 Oded as Ginkgo:  Let me roll.

82:19 Oded as Ginkgo:  So that would be 12 hit points.

82:21 Chris as Boone:  All right. Awesome. Thanks.

82:23 Oded as Ginkgo:  And with my last action, I'm just gonna get.

82:31 Oded as Ginkgo:  I can't. I still can't move my character.

82:33 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm not sure why. I wanna get closer to within touching distance of Donkey so that I can heal with

82:42 Oded as Ginkgo:  my kit next turn.

82:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  Maybe not as close to the.

82:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  To the bear, but. Yeah, that's perfect.

82:53 Gary the DM:  Okay.

82:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

82:58 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

82:58 Gary the DM:  The bear is up. All right.

83:03 Gary the DM:  The bear swings at Babishon. 14.

83:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Miss. 16.

83:14 Gary the DM:  All right, so that's a miss.

83:16 Gary the DM:  The SW's is claused. I wish I Moves out of the way, it'll make a second claw attack.

83:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  14.

83:27 Gary the DM:  That's also.

83:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

83:32 Gary the DM:  And then it'll bite.

83:45 Gary the DM:  All right, it's also. That's a 15.

83:47 Gary the DM:  So that's a mess.

83:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't know what the big deal was.

83:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Boom.

83:56 Gary the DM:  All right, so, Boom, you're at 12.

83:57 Chris as Boone:  Let's see.

83:58 David as Donkey:  Four.

84:00 Gary the DM:  Sean, you're up.

84:03 Chris as Boone:  All right.

84:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let'S see. I think I will try and move to the other side of the bear to try and get

84:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  flanking, and then I will take a swing at him with my short sword.

84:24 Gary the DM:  Okay.

84:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No, that's a six.

84:30 Gary the DM:  That would miss. Yeah. Second attack.

84:34 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think I will do a second attack.

84:37 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Yeah. Eleven.

84:42 Gary the DM:  That's a miss.

84:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Does that include the bonuses for flanking?

84:47 Gary the DM:  Oh, yeah. So that's plus four has 15.

84:50 Gary the DM:  Yeah, that hits.

84:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Nice.

84:52 Gary the DM:  I just did the two from the thing.

84:54 Gary the DM:  Okay. Condition or whatever.

84:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Six damage.

85:03 Gary the DM:  Six.

85:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

85:16 Gary the DM:  Bunky, you're unconscious.

85:21 Gary the DM:  The rats.

85:24 Oded as Ginkgo:  Squirrels. Squirrels.

85:26 Gary the DM:  Darn it.

85:26 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

85:33 Gary the DM:  All right, so we got three attacks on ginkgo.

85:37 Gary the DM:  That for that. Moved in and attacked you,

85:43 Gary the DM:  Leaps at you and tries to bite your ankle with a 16.

85:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  Where do I see my AC? I didn't even check it.

85:52 Gary the DM:  It's up on the top left kind of.

85:54 Oded as Ginkgo:  It's. It's a 15. So that's a hit.

85:58 Gary the DM:  That's a hit. A 12 from the other one that tries to bite you.

86:05 Gary the DM:  13.

86:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  What you say 13 is a miss.

86:11 Gary the DM:  Only one bite. I need a Fortitude save.

86:18 Gary the DM:  And it did four points of piercing damage to you.

86:25 Oded as Ginkgo:  Where is Fortitude?

86:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Four points of piercing at the top.

86:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Middle.

86:34 Chris as Boone:  Just says fort.

86:35 Gary the DM:  Oh, Fortitude. Yeah, they're across the top.

86:40 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, yeah.

86:47 Gary the DM:  You're good, too.

86:48 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, so four points of damage.

86:51 Chris as Boone:  Yep.

86:59 Gary the DM:  And then it is. Boom. You're up.

87:06 Chris as Boone:  All right, so.

87:12 Chris as Boone:  Trying to get back to the.

87:13 Chris as Boone:  Okay, so.

87:15 David as Donkey:  Man.

87:16 Chris as Boone:  All right, there's the bear. There's the two squirrels.

87:21 Chris as Boone:  I mean,

87:25 Chris as Boone:  so I. I am just sort of yelling as I move, like, we can run away.

87:32 Chris as Boone:  Do we need to scoop up.

87:36 Chris as Boone:  Scoop up our friend and run away or stay to fight? And in the meantime, I guess I will move

87:48 Chris as Boone:  up to the bear. And if I go here, I think.

87:52 Chris as Boone:  I mean, he's flanked anyway, so

87:58 Chris as Boone:  let's see.

88:04 Chris as Boone:  But, yeah, I'll move right next to Donkey because he's still unconscious, right? Yeah.

88:09 David as Donkey:  Yes.

88:09 Chris as Boone:  Yep. Okay, so I'm right next to Donkey.

88:14 Chris as Boone:  I'll attack the bear.

88:15 Gary the DM:  Okay, let's see.

88:27 Chris as Boone:  12, and he. I think he's minus some stuff with flanking, and I'm not sure if he's still frightened.

88:33 Gary the DM:  Yeah, see, it's minus four. That's a hit.

88:44 Chris as Boone:  I didn't make points, so just 12.

88:49 Chris as Boone:  Oh, nope. Sorry. 10. 10 damage.

88:52 Gary the DM:  Oh, 10 damage. Oh, all right.

88:54 Gary the DM:  With that slice, the bear, it was quiet.

89:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Finally.

89:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  Is it dead?

89:05 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

89:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No.

89:10 Gary the DM:  As it. It lays there lifeless as spores kind of spread off of it.

89:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The.

89:20 Gary the DM:  Boon standing there victorious with his sword deep into its side as we move to Ginkgo.

89:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  You're up.

89:28 Chris as Boone:  I think I have a third action, so I'll just raise my shield.

89:31 Gary the DM:  Was that.

89:31 Chris as Boone:  Oh, okay. Well, you did move.

89:33 Gary the DM:  Oh, yeah. Moving, then. One attack, right?

89:35 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

89:35 Gary the DM:  No, yeah. Never mind. I thought that second 10 was your attack, but, yeah, you have one more action.

89:40 Gary the DM:  Yep.

89:41 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, I. I can't reach. I can't move.

89:44 Chris as Boone:  Well, no, I could move again, so I'll move just in an attempt to maybe present a target to these

89:54 Chris as Boone:  things. I guess I'll be right there.

89:56 Gary the DM:  All right, Gekko, you're next. And then that'll be followed by.

90:04 Oded as Ginkgo:  I want to grab one of the squirrels and apply salve.

90:10 Oded as Ginkgo:  Right.

90:11 Gary the DM:  I'm giving an unarmed strike against one of the squirrels.

90:25 Gary the DM:  Come on, six. There's. They're quick little things.

90:33 Gary the DM:  It skates around as you're trying to grab it.

90:36 Gary the DM:  That's your one attack. You get your second one.

90:39 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

90:46 Gary the DM:  All right. So still good grab.

90:50 Chris as Boone:  Donkey's unconscious, and you're, like, grabbing squirrels.

90:55 Oded as Ginkgo:  Let me save one animal.

91:01 Gary the DM:  You still have one more action you can try to grab.

91:03 Gary the DM:  You won't have the interact action to apply the sav this round, but.

91:08 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, screw it. I'm going to try and heal Donkey.

91:15 Gary the DM:  Okay.

91:18 Oded as Ginkgo:  With my healer skit.

91:20 Gary the DM:  Okay. Yeah. Roll your medicine. Check.

91:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Nice.

91:27 Gary the DM:  20. All right, that does work.

91:31 David as Donkey:  Let's see.

91:34 Gary the DM:  Hasn't been treat wounds, I think.

91:36 Gary the DM:  Let's see.

91:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Wow. The way the light now shines off of Gary's head.

91:44 Gary the DM:  You like it?

91:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Read the rules. I had.

91:49 Gary the DM:  Let's see.

91:52 Chris as Boone:  There'S a whole table for you.

91:54 Gary the DM:  Get two D8 hit points.

91:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

91:56 Gary the DM:  Roll two D8.

92:04 Gary the DM:  So your healing spell is guaranteed to do 9, but medicine would be 2 to 16.

92:11 Oded as Ginkgo:  To the 8.

92:14 Gary the DM:  4.

92:26 Oded as Ginkgo:  Why? Why did it wrong one.

92:29 Oded as Ginkgo:  One D eight plus two.

92:31 Gary the DM:  I don't know. It's supposed to be.

92:32 Gary the DM:  I think I'm a success.

92:34 Oded as Ginkgo:  Oh, sorry. I changed the modifier instead of the number of rows.

92:39 Oded as Ginkgo:  Let me roll again. One more.

92:43 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right, so I guess it's three.

92:45 Oded as Ginkgo:  No, wait, it's a 1D6. Sorry, I got it now.

92:52 Gary the DM:  Two plus.

92:55 Oded as Ginkgo:  No, I don't got it.

93:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay. Okay, so that's. That's an eight.

93:05 Oded as Ginkgo:  Nine total.

93:06 Gary the DM:  Yes, nine total.

93:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yep.

93:09 Gary the DM:  They have nine hit points back there.

93:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Bounty Gary's wishing for us. Buy some die.

93:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Dice.

93:19 Gary the DM:  You'Re up next.

93:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I am going to use an action to sprint at the other squirrel, the one on the right.

93:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And I'm gonna take a flying leap clear across the little people and try and tackle the squirrel and.

93:37 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And restrain it.

93:38 Gary the DM:  All right. I guess. Give me first an athletics check.

93:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, God. This is where it all goes bad.

93:47 Gary the DM:  To leap over the group or.

93:50 Gary the DM:  Oh, nice.

93:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They're not very tall.

93:53 Gary the DM:  You leap and parkour over them.

93:55 Gary the DM:  And now give me. That's your one action for your movement.

93:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

93:58 Gary the DM:  Your second action. Give me unarmed attack, I guess, or grapple check, I guess you try.

94:03 Gary the DM:  Give me a grapple skill. You're here.

94:10 Gary the DM:  And it'll be. So that'll be your athletics check against the vicious squirrel who did not roll.

94:16 Gary the DM:  Great.

94:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's probably under basic actions. Special to basics.

94:26 Chris as Boone:  Where is grapple Would be athletics again.

94:30 Gary the DM:  It's like skill check.

94:31 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

94:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, okay. I don't. I don't have a grapple skill.

94:35 Gary the DM:  Yeah, no, it's a grapple attack or grapple.

94:38 Gary the DM:  Yeah, it's a grapple attack.

94:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, athletics. Gotcha.

94:49 David as Donkey:  If you open the little expando on athletics, you can see all the skill actions.

94:58 Gary the DM:  So that was shot and runs and leaps over the group, tumbles over, and you see cloud of dirt and

95:05 Gary the DM:  dust as he rolls up and he's holding a squirrel in his hands.

95:11 Gary the DM:  I don't know. By the tail, maybe by the tail in his body as it's squirting around.

95:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  There you go, Ginka. I got you one.

95:20 Gary the DM:  That's your. That's your second action.

95:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, God.

95:24 Gary the DM:  One more.

95:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think. I didn't think this through all the.

95:27 Chris as Boone:  Way.

95:33 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And I don't have any more salve.

95:37 Gary the DM:  You. You don't. Oh, you made that sav bomb.

95:42 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's true. Can I just set off the salve bomb with us standing in the middle of it? Because the

95:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  squirrels are right here.

95:50 Gary the DM:  You could.

95:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, yeah. What's the worst that could happen? I'm just gonna.

95:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm just gonna.

95:56 Gary the DM:  All right, so you. You lay down the sav grenade.

96:01 Gary the DM:  I guess you guys don't have to worry, but I'll do the fortitude save.

96:07 Gary the DM:  So the. The squirrels. There's like, boom, blast of this.

96:12 Gary the DM:  This goo that streaks out splatters on parts of the tree that's there where it hits the.

96:18 Gary the DM:  The moss, basically. The. The yellow, you know, does the exact same thing, kind of graze and start to flake

96:28 Gary the DM:  off pretty quickly on the tree in the areas that.

96:31 Gary the DM:  And on the Ground where it happens to be growing on the roots and stuff.

96:35 Gary the DM:  And where it hits the squirrels.

96:36 Gary the DM:  You notice that both the squirrels, their eyes start to fade back to like more red, normal kind of color.

96:43 Gary the DM:  They calm down greatly. And the one that was by Ginkgo's feet, you know, looks up and has a, you

96:52 Gary the DM:  know, big bold puppy dog on, you know, shameful eyes on it as it scampers off to try to get

96:59 Gary the DM:  away. The one in which scampers off this direction, the one that Baba Sean is holding, calms down and then

97:11 Gary the DM:  looks at you and then seems like it's trying to, you know, fight to get away a little bit.

97:15 Gary the DM:  But not in the vicious, aggressive manner that it had before.

97:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I totally didn't forget that we made a.

97:29 Gary the DM:  All right, so it. You let it go and it scampers off into the woods.

97:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll ask Inko if he wants to commune with it.

97:40 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I guess I don't know how the.

97:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  Mushroom people work, but with the squirrel.

97:45 Oded as Ginkgo:  I don't talk squirrel. You can let it go.

97:47 Oded as Ginkgo:  That's fine.

97:52 David as Donkey:  I have a shaman. That is so offensive.

97:56 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The orcs don't know much about the Leshy people.

97:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All right.

98:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  I appreciate the gesture.

98:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

98:03 Chris as Boone:  All right.

98:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll let it go then.

98:08 Chris as Boone:  So, okay, so we're all like covered in stuff and sort of breathing, but we're not in combat anymore, right?

98:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Just don't ask what stuff we're covered in.

98:19 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

98:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

98:20 Chris as Boone:  All right. I say sorry Ginko.

98:22 Chris as Boone:  You know, I think it was killer be killed.

98:25 Chris as Boone:  All right, what. What's next guys?

98:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  I. I want to take a minute with the bear.

98:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  I'm. I'm going to put my hands on the bear and I guess I'll say something like the soil welcomes

98:41 Oded as Ginkgo:  you. By tomorrow the forest will know your name.

98:45 Gary the DM:  Right?

98:46 Oded as Ginkgo:  Right. Smiles.

98:50 Gary the DM:  It doesn't do anything. It just lays there.

98:51 Gary the DM:  But it. You can feel that its spirit appreciates and.

98:55 Gary the DM:  And you know, it passing into, you know, nature's bounty on the other side as it feels at peace.

99:06 Gary the DM:  The rest of the forest, as you look around, you know, other than that it, you know, is still no

99:11 Gary the DM:  other creatures come after you. You have the, the bowl that Dan pulled out and inside there like I said

99:19 Gary the DM:  there was like insect and like moth kind of butterfly wings in there kind of crushed from tattered a little

99:27 Gary the DM:  bit. But you could still enough remains that you can see.

99:30 Gary the DM:  And then there's the dagger that's still stuck in the earth in that little gaping area between those roots.

99:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Can I? Yeah. This was all one handed by the way.

99:43 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I had the Bowl. Can I investigate the.

99:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The bowl and the dagger? I'll.

99:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll name another investigation for whatever the happened to this willow.

99:57 Gary the DM:  You can,

100:03 Gary the DM:  I guess, give me a. A perception check? Yeah, you bet.

100:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  24.

100:15 Gary the DM:  24.

100:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

100:17 Gary the DM:  And then the other plus one.

100:19 Gary the DM:  So 20, 25. Yep. So you see the so in the bowl? What appears to be in there? It looks

100:33 Gary the DM:  like the wings of moths primarily.

100:39 Gary the DM:  So the bodies aren't there, but only the wings are.

100:43 Gary the DM:  The bowl itself, like I said, is non description.

100:47 Gary the DM:  There's no etchings on it or anything like that.

100:50 Gary the DM:  The dagger is a steel dagger with kind of a leather wrapped handle.

100:57 Gary the DM:  You know, nothing out of the ordinary there.

100:59 Gary the DM:  It's got kind of a hook kind of blade to it.

101:02 Gary the DM:  There's etchings on the side of it which look like a language.

101:07 Gary the DM:  Anybody have occultism?

101:10 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

101:11 Gary the DM:  Okay, so give me. Give me an occult autism.

101:13 Gary the DM:  Check.

101:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  21.

101:19 Gary the DM:  All right, so in.

101:37 Gary the DM:  The language is. It's. You're not super familiar with it.

101:41 Gary the DM:  It's toanin, which is like a infernal language.

101:47 Gary the DM:  Older tongue, but in your like researching of like different occult, you know, books and things, you run across it

101:56 Gary the DM:  enough to decipher the phrase that's on the dagger.

102:00 Gary the DM:  It's not a name or anything.

102:02 Gary the DM:  It's a. It's a free piece.

102:04 Gary the DM:  It said, let ancient law be sealed in the hand that guides Willow Shore.

102:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So with my imperial lore, do I think that that has more to do with the oni coming in or

102:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  the. Or the previous ruling family?

102:29 Gary the DM:  I guess. Yeah. Give me. Give me your imperial lore.

102:31 Gary the DM:  Check. And then actually Donkey, as he says that phrase, give me a.

102:38 Gary the DM:  A society check. Or your Willow Shore war Check.

102:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  24. And I think.

102:49 Gary the DM:  Okay, 24.

102:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  So.

103:00 Gary the DM:  There's actually a 16 for donkey because it's a plus one because it's part of your investigation.

103:04 Gary the DM:  But yeah. So Donkey, you've heard not that whole phrase, but part of it.

103:14 Gary the DM:  Hand that guides was a reference to the oni magistrate early when he first arrived.

103:30 Gary the DM:  And yeah, the.

103:35 Gary the DM:  I guess in your imperial lore.

103:37 Gary the DM:  Check. This language is one that the oni would

103:45 Gary the DM:  see natively speak, but is a.

103:48 Gary the DM:  A common dialect among the oni.

103:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay,

103:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  so we think. We think the oni probably have a hand in this,

104:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  especially because they.

104:04 Gary the DM:  The.

104:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The magistrate have been making trips out to this willow.

104:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right. And so this seems like some kind of ritual for the oni to claim some power.

104:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is my.

104:16 Chris as Boone:  My.

104:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Is my supposition.

104:23 David as Donkey:  We don't know though if the dagger and bowl are connected to the fungus.

104:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No, I guess I'm assuming they Are.

104:35 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Let's see.

104:38 David as Donkey:  Because it could have been like, if the oni is trying to use the power of the willow for good

104:43 David as Donkey:  or ill, the fungus might be trying to like, negate or counteract it.

104:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Can I spend. Can I pursue a league? Can I spend a minute studying the.

104:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The lichen and bowl and the knife and see if I can gather information?

105:03 Gary the DM:  I guess. Give me a.

105:08 Gary the DM:  An occultism check for your gather information.

105:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yes. Just had it. There it is.

105:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Another 24. Wow. I walk great when I'm not.

105:24 Gary the DM:  Don't shoot a. Anymore.

105:27 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Dang.

105:29 Gary the DM:  So piecing those kind of together and seeing, you know, thinking back of other rituals that you may have encountered

105:38 Gary the DM:  and their offshoots, the.

105:46 Chris as Boone:  The.

105:46 Gary the DM:  The ritual is. Okay. The lichens are part.

105:53 Gary the DM:  An after effect of the ritual.

105:56 Gary the DM:  From the. The way that it's almost like blood splatter, the way that it would have arced out from this

106:03 Gary the DM:  hole when. When the final ritual, whatever was done inside of this little area, the energy out of that caused

106:13 Gary the DM:  the tree to react. So it is a byproduct of this ritual.

106:20 Gary the DM:  This ritual. You see some blood stains in the bowl and on the knife as well, that minor flex.

106:29 Gary the DM:  But in your investigation, you kind of picked up on a few of those.

106:32 Gary the DM:  And so this is definitely a dark ritual, some type of exchange of power.

106:38 Gary the DM:  And you're not exactly sure what it's tied to, but maybe some summoning of ancient earth spirit or spirit of

106:51 Gary the DM:  the forest or something along those lines is what your initial investigation and hunch seems to indicate.

107:00 Gary the DM:  It's definitely some communion or summoning kind of process.

107:06 Gary the DM:  It was a sacrificial kind of like substitution ritual to either commune or summon something.

107:13 Gary the DM:  Like I said, it's either a dark spirit, spirit of the woods, some.

107:17 Gary the DM:  Something along those lines. And whatever happened here, you feel like the ritual was at least partially or fully successful

107:27 Gary the DM:  because of this. The energy that was given off that caused the blight, as well as the feeling from Donkey

107:36 Gary the DM:  and ginkgo when arriving in the woods, like this area has changed from, you know, this effect.

107:44 Gary the DM:  It's been affected by it.

107:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And do we think that if.

107:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll share this with the group, but do we think that if we remove the bowl and knife or like

107:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  destroy them, that it'll help lessen the.

107:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The effect of the spells?

108:00 Gary the DM:  No.

108:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

108:02 Gary the DM:  Yeah. There doesn't, like, whatever ritual has been completed and those don't even really need to be there.

108:13 Gary the DM:  In your opinion, you guys could take them and not have any ill effects.

108:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Ginkgo, can you commune with the tree and See if there's anything we can do to lessen the spell.

108:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't know if you speak tree.

108:30 David as Donkey:  Or just slap stab on it.

108:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah, I can use the salve to get rid of the lichen.

108:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm just worried that we can get rid of the lichen now.

108:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But what if it comes back?

108:44 Oded as Ginkgo:  Well, yeah, I. I guess I want to do a thorough job and make sure that nothing stays.

108:52 Oded as Ginkgo:  If. If it's a side effect of the spell and the spell is over, then it shouldn't come back.

108:56 Oded as Ginkgo:  If we get rid of all.

109:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I guess that makes sense.

109:05 David as Donkey:  Should I. Yeah, we should definitely, like, come back in a few days and see if we see any new

109:11 David as Donkey:  growth.

109:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can definitely do that.

109:14 Gary the DM:  You don't need to check for it because you guys can take some time.

109:16 Gary the DM:  Like it's been, you know, it's probably like 4:30 now.

109:19 Gary the DM:  The sun's a little bit lower in the horizon after this battle.

109:21 Gary the DM:  And as you check everywhere and like I said, it's spread out like in a blast radius of it, you

109:26 Gary the DM:  know, in streaks. So you have like the trees, you looking along the roots and areas as you're making sure

109:31 Gary the DM:  that you find any last r.

109:33 Gary the DM:  You circle around and the rest of the party, I assume, is helping as well as you.

109:38 Gary the DM:  You cover this area and find like all the yellow, you know, mossy kind of lins that were on it

109:44 Gary the DM:  now are gray or gone as they flake off after being affected by, you know, the ginkgo savvy juice that,

109:54 Gary the DM:  that he has. So it's a little bit, you know, closer to darks, like 5:30 now.

110:00 Gary the DM:  The sun is like a very, you know, orange ball barely over the.

110:03 Gary the DM:  The tree line as it, you know, you get this orange glow and yellowy kind of sky.

110:11 Gary the DM:  Likely light clouds as. As it's starting to darken.

110:15 Gary the DM:  You guys head back to Willow Shore to the south, walk past the.

110:21 Gary the DM:  The graveyard. And no, no ill effects there as you go back to the Silver mist in and regroup.

110:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  1.

110:32 Gary the DM:  I guess at this point you definitely.

110:34 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Don'T want a dark woods.

110:38 Chris as Boone:  Did you keep the.

110:39 David as Donkey:  Yeah.

110:40 Chris as Boone:  Did the knife have. And the knife had writing on it or something?

110:42 Gary the DM:  The knife did have writing on it, yeah.

110:44 Chris as Boone:  Okay, so you still have that.

110:45 Chris as Boone:  And what about the butterfly things? You shove them in a pocket or something?

110:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  No, I'm just carrying the bowl the whole time.

110:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay.

110:53 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

110:53 Gary the DM:  All right.

110:54 Chris as Boone:  So you got the weird ritual stuff still.

110:57 Gary the DM:  So we're back.

110:57 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

110:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't know if any of us have like a bag of holding or similar.

111:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'm just Carrying it awkwardly.

111:04 Chris as Boone:  We've all got backpacks, I think.

111:06 Gary the DM:  Yeah. Some type of pouch or backpack or something.

111:09 Gary the DM:  A lot of people in the default equipment.

111:12 Gary the DM:  As you guys get back into town, you get to the close to the silver mist end and that's when

111:21 Gary the DM:  Yong the blacksmith approaches the group and he's carrying some weapons.

111:29 David as Donkey:  Yeah.

111:31 Gary the DM:  And he hands them to. I think one was for Boone and the other one was.

111:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Was it.

111:40 Gary the DM:  Who's the other one? I thought there was two.

111:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Dyson Me.

111:43 Gary the DM:  Is it Devonshine? Okay. He hands those to you and you guys.

111:49 Gary the DM:  Thanks again. He said, oh, I was able able to finish them and I, I, I did something special for

111:56 Gary the DM:  you. Like I. You've done really in the, the day I met you so much in my.

112:03 Gary the DM:  You rescued my son from, from a fire, you know, helped him with help the town recently.

112:13 Gary the DM:  And so you look on the, on the blades.

112:17 Gary the DM:  Yours, I think yours was more of a spear.

112:19 Gary the DM:  If I remember Dagwashan, yours was like a hillbird, right.

112:26 Gary the DM:  Kind of like a long pole.

112:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Guandao, which is like a polearm.

112:31 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

112:32 Gary the DM:  Okay. Yeah. There's an etched rune on each of them.

112:36 Gary the DM:  So it's an arcane rune. So if you look when you add your weapon,

112:47 Gary the DM:  There are. Oh shoot,

112:54 Gary the DM:  I did this before. So I.

112:57 Gary the DM:  There are.

113:07 Gary the DM:  I had this working.

113:12 Gary the DM:  It's a. There should be a striking rune, I think it's called.

113:18 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. If you click on the weapon once it's in your inventory.

113:21 David as Donkey:  Inventory.

113:22 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

113:22 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

113:23 Gary the DM:  You have to. Once you add the weapon, you can add a rune to it.

113:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yep.

113:27 Gary the DM:  And it should be a striking rune.

113:28 Gary the DM:  I think it gives you plus one to damage and plus one to hit, basically.

113:32 Gary the DM:  In Pathfinder, runes were used a lot for like enhancing weapons.

113:37 Gary the DM:  So some weapons can only one rune.

113:39 Gary the DM:  You'll find different types of runes that can do different things.

113:42 Gary the DM:  Like, you know, this one's about the striking rune.

113:45 Gary the DM:  There's like one for better critical hits.

113:47 Gary the DM:  You could have like a, a flaming rune which allows it to do flaming damage and stuff.

113:51 Gary the DM:  So, so you can basically upgrade and change your, your equipment by you know, engraving these arcane runes into the

113:58 Gary the DM:  weapon. So Yong has had that done for your weapons.

114:02 Chris as Boone:  Awesome.

114:04 Gary the DM:  As a, as an additional. Thank you for all the stuff you've done in will.

114:07 Gary the DM:  Sure. He he says he's gonna stay for the, for the festival and maybe a few days after that to

114:15 Gary the DM:  plan where they're going to go and say goodbye to some of his close friends.

114:19 Gary the DM:  You know, here in Wilshore that you know, him and Hong have grown up around.

114:24 Gary the DM:  But at some point he is Going to, you know, because of your help, venture off and try to start

114:32 Gary the DM:  his blacksmithing practice at a town more towards the coast.

114:40 Gary the DM:  His son loves, wants to see the ocean.

114:43 Gary the DM:  So he's going to try to do something like that in a different city entirely.

114:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's awesome. This is amazing. Young.

114:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It's better than I had hoped for.

114:59 Chris as Boone:  Excellent craftsmanship. Young.

115:03 Gary the DM:  You're welcome. Because I hope. I hope, honestly, I hope you don't need to use them often, but I appreciate

115:10 Gary the DM:  the thanks.

115:14 Gary the DM:  He walks off his some kind of is not too far away as he, you know, waves to you guys.

115:20 Gary the DM:  And you can see Yang and long puts his arm around him a little bit and they walk off.

115:27 Gary the DM:  You see them talking a little bit as they walk back towards where, you know, his forge is.

115:32 Gary the DM:  And you guys are now quietly in the Silver mist Inn and head back to your room.

115:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll pull out a sharpening stone and start sharpening this.

115:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Not that I don't think y' all did a great idea.

115:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Great job, but, you know, gotta be careful.

115:54 David as Donkey:  I bet you go to a restaurant and you start putting salt and pepper on the food before you even

115:58 David as Donkey:  taste it.

115:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Said I actually bring my own little bottle of orcish hot sauce.

116:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Then a little holster.

116:12 Gary the DM:  It's like 9:30. I don't know.

116:14 Gary the DM:  Do you guys want to go to 10 or you want to end it here or.

116:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Not? Flexible.

116:21 David as Donkey:  Yeah, it's up to you.

116:22 Chris as Boone:  Is there anything we need to do tonight? I know.

116:25 Chris as Boone:  Let's see. I know Ginkgo has his glamour appointment in the morning.

116:29 Chris as Boone:  Is there something we. Anything else we're going to try to accomplish today?

116:35 Oded as Ginkgo:  Maybe we can ask Migo about the spell, See if she has any takes.

116:45 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We may also want to follow up with Yang's son before they leave town to see if he heard anything

116:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  from the other children.

116:50 Chris as Boone:  Oh, yeah.

116:55 Gary the DM:  Okay. So you guys all go together or in different groups.

117:02 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Or we could split up and do both.

117:07 Gary the DM:  Who wants to go talk to.

117:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll go. I'll go talk to the child.

117:15 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, I'll go with you.

117:17 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

117:18 Gary the DM:  Yeah, we're not go talk to.

117:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Child again. Okay.

117:27 Gary the DM:  And then the. The other folks, Ginkgo and Donkey go up upstairs to.

117:35 Gary the DM:  First they. To get upstairs, you have to be.

117:42 Gary the DM:  So the young lady who's a hostess goes upstairs first to see if the elder will greet you.

117:55 Gary the DM:  And a few minutes later, she comes back down and nods and says, please follow me.

118:04 Gary the DM:  Elder Mido will meet you. So you follow her up and you go to the same path to the left

118:08 Gary the DM:  there on the end of the hall where she has her.

118:11 Gary the DM:  Her area. You go inside and there's, you know, the two, you know, guard folks near her.

118:19 Gary the DM:  As she's sitting there, she offers you guys to sit again.

118:25 Gary the DM:  She's a nice tea.

118:29 David as Donkey:  So before we go up to see her, I want to consult with Ginkgo.

118:34 David as Donkey:  Is there anything that we should, like, do we trust her with all of the information we have? Is there

118:40 David as Donkey:  anything we should conceal? Like, should we conceal the fact that we saw the bow and the dagger?

118:49 Oded as Ginkgo:  Well, I think it will help to share those details.

118:53 Oded as Ginkgo:  Like maybe she knows something specific about the spell.

118:56 Oded as Ginkgo:  Right. Oh, yeah.

118:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'll give you all the bowl and the dagger before we leave.

119:03 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yep. I noticed that one. One of the, like, moth wings is missing.

119:08 Oded as Ginkgo:  Died by shadow.

119:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  What if I was hungry?

119:17 Gary the DM:  All right, so do you. Do you bring them with you, or are you just gonna say, is that what

119:22 Gary the DM:  I heard? Babish, bring him with us?

119:25 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah, I think we lay out everything.

119:27 Oded as Ginkgo:  Like, I feel like she didn't give us any reason yet to not trust her.

119:34 Oded as Ginkgo:  And we don't have any other leads or any other allies.

119:40 Gary the DM:  So you go into a room.

119:42 Gary the DM:  She, as you guys sit down, and it says, please.

119:48 Gary the DM:  She gestures to the 1. Pour them some tea as well.

119:52 Gary the DM:  And so larger kind of guy reaches down, pours out of this, you know, pitcher that's.

119:58 Gary the DM:  That's nearby, fills some cups for you both of tea.

120:03 Gary the DM:  And she grabs, you know, both hands and takes a drink and puts it down.

120:07 Gary the DM:  She says, so how can I help the.

120:11 Gary the DM:  The young heroes of Willowshore. You made quite, quite an impression already in the.

120:17 Gary the DM:  In several days. Rescue of children at a fire and fighting off the undead.

120:27 Gary the DM:  It's amazing what tomorrow will bring.

120:32 Oded as Ginkgo:  First of all, do you have any more of the rice cakes that you had last time?

120:39 Gary the DM:  I'm glad you like them, young Ginkgo.

120:42 Gary the DM:  Of course we do. So street gestures to the guy, he goes off and brings back a platter with several

120:48 Gary the DM:  of them in there, and he puts them down in front of you.

120:52 Oded as Ginkgo:  Nice. Ginkgo's happy.

121:00 David as Donkey:  Well, we got some findings from the forest that might shed some light on what will happen soon.

121:08 David as Donkey:  So I'm going to basically go over, like, what all we saw in the clearing.

121:14 David as Donkey:  The bowl and the dagger, the impression in the grass, the fungus and the animals.

121:22 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay.

121:25 Gary the DM:  And she's listening intently. And you see, she takes another drink and pauses for a second.

121:32 Gary the DM:  It says, it's.

121:38 Gary the DM:  Disturbing.

121:43 Gary the DM:  Thought we would have seen him do this ritual.

121:47 Gary the DM:  If it's what I believe he has done, it's.

121:53 Gary the DM:  It's a summoning ritual.

121:59 Gary the DM:  Of old.

121:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  Who is he summoning?

122:02 Gary the DM:  That I'm not exactly sure, but there's.

122:11 Gary the DM:  You said what was in the bowl.

122:13 Gary the DM:  You said it was insects in the bowl.

122:17 David as Donkey:  Insect wings.

122:19 Gary the DM:  Just their wings?

122:23 David as Donkey:  Yeah.

122:38 Gary the DM:  And this was at the base of the.

122:43 Gary the DM:  The Mourn Dust trend. I have a feeling it's old demonic summoning.

123:02 Gary the DM:  Not of our gods or any.

123:07 Gary the DM:  And I believe the Mourn Dust Tree is a requirement.

123:13 Gary the DM:  It's almost the lightning rod for this.

123:19 Gary the DM:  This summoning, it reaches back into the ancient earth with its deep roots and its ancient history.

123:28 Gary the DM:  To bring up this

123:33 Gary the DM:  ancient demon of pestilence is my guess.

123:41 Gary the DM:  Hence the. The lichens that formed and the elements in the bowl.

123:57 David as Donkey:  So if he's trying to bring a plague on Willowshore, why would he.

124:08 Gary the DM:  I think the. I don't. I don't know if this.

124:12 Gary the DM:  I think. I don't remember the name or if it even had a name.

124:15 Gary the DM:  This demon, this Pestilence, this mother of a thousand wings, I believe is what some folks called it and why

124:26 Gary the DM:  here. This is a. Willow shore is a very interesting location, a very interesting place.

124:37 Gary the DM:  While I'm. I'm not sure you are a studious person, young donkey, in.

124:46 Gary the DM:  In the arcane arts, there's a.

124:51 Gary the DM:  Well, we see, you know, the rivers, we see the mountains, we see the trees.

124:56 Gary the DM:  There's a. What some folks have called it, you know, arcane lines or ley lines along these geomancy paths deep

125:07 Gary the DM:  in the earth. And some forms of magic of old were rumored to tap into these pathways.

125:19 Gary the DM:  We see the five rivers joining, but I think this is also a joining of those crossing of those lines

125:29 Gary the DM:  and makes a focal point that if you're schooled in that area, can leverage and expand your power by thinking.

125:46 Gary the DM:  The reason that I've been, I guess, spying on our.

125:54 Gary the DM:  Our new magistrate as. I was worried when I saw him.

125:59 Gary the DM:  Carol, I would say more about what's going on outside of Willowshore and in the woods and preparing for his

126:07 Gary the DM:  illustrious mayor, which he was said to have leading.

126:16 Gary the DM:  Perhaps this magistrate. Like I said, I believe he's more than he appears.

126:22 Gary the DM:  I think he's more than a diplomat with a strong sword arm.

126:26 Gary the DM:  Perhaps he is well versed in these.

126:29 Gary the DM:  And why Will ashore is on his assignment and why the Mourn Dust Tree was an area that he was

126:37 Gary the DM:  very interested in.

126:40 David as Donkey:  Wait, the mayor hasn't showed up yet?

126:44 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right?

126:45 David as Donkey:  The magistrate is here before him?

126:47 Gary the DM:  Yes.

126:48 David as Donkey:  Maybe he's trying to summon the mayor.

126:53 Gary the DM:  I hope our mayor is not an old demonic Pestilence guy, but maybe.

127:01 Gary the DM:  You have a very twisted mind, young Donkey.

127:12 David as Donkey:  I guess my next question is, has the ritual already been completed? Is there a way to stop or undo

127:19 David as Donkey:  it or like, what can we do next?

127:26 Gary the DM:  Well, sadly, I don't know enough in that.

127:30 Gary the DM:  That area to help. I think we would have to do some research.

127:37 Gary the DM:  Perhaps the young magistrate has some books or other items that could give us some clues.

127:47 Gary the DM:  He's very. We know his estate very well and so there might be ways for us to peek into what

127:59 Gary the DM:  he's doing inside his. Our former home to.

128:03 Gary the DM:  To glean some information that way.

128:08 Gary the DM:  Then there's

128:12 Gary the DM:  the hills and even the, you know, some of the only society might be the other area to get.

128:17 Gary the DM:  There's the hills to the south.

128:21 Gary the DM:  The mountains to the south are old former mining towns and other, you know, cities of generations ago.

128:31 Gary the DM:  Perhaps they have a clue, but I think it's beyond.

128:38 Gary the DM:  It's beyond my knowledge at this point.

128:40 Gary the DM:  I've dabbled in some of these arts, but I'm.

128:45 Gary the DM:  I'm not an accomplished arcanist by any means.

128:54 David as Donkey:  If someone wanted to get into.

128:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  The.

128:59 David as Donkey:  Compound where the magistrate is staying and just poke around.

129:05 Gary the DM:  How would they best do that? Well, if you are trying to poke around without going through the front door,

129:14 Gary the DM:  there are a few alternate paths into our former estate.

129:24 Gary the DM:  We have. There's a passageway from the stables.

129:31 Chris as Boone:  That.

129:31 Gary the DM:  Can take you into the tunnels under it takes you into essentially our wine cellar.

129:41 Gary the DM:  I don't believe he has done anything with that.

129:45 Gary the DM:  Another option is we have a very nice koi pond and there is a way under the koi pond to

129:56 Gary the DM:  venture into this state as well.

130:01 Oded as Ginkgo:  Like through the koi pond.

130:04 Gary the DM:  Do I.

130:05 Oded as Ginkgo:  Through the koi pond?

130:07 Gary the DM:  Through the base of the koi pond.

130:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

130:15 Oded as Ginkgo:  All right.

130:22 Oded as Ginkgo:  Should we know? Like, do you.

130:23 Gary the DM:  Do you have any or so only rumors?

130:25 Oded as Ginkgo:  Any rumors?

130:26 Gary the DM:  Of course, if anybody asks, there's no way anybody would know about those entrances.

130:38 Oded as Ginkgo:  Naturally.

130:40 David as Donkey:  And this is all hypothetical.

130:42 Gary the DM:  That's obviously hypothetical, but old homes sometimes had escape routes.

130:51 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay,

130:59 Oded as Ginkgo:  I guess. Thank you for the hypothetical information.

131:06 David as Donkey:  And the rice cakes.

131:07 Oded as Ginkgo:  Anybody's case, of course.

131:09 Gary the DM:  Very welcome.

131:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And.

131:10 Gary the DM:  And if our mayor's timetable is.

131:15 Gary the DM:  Is accurate, I. I suppose we'll be seeing you at the ritual friendship tomorrow evening.

131:26 Gary the DM:  It. I'm sure it'll be very interesting and good like them with your investigation.

131:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Thank you.

131:37 Gary the DM:  So the other two, you guys catch up pretty quickly to Hong and Yang as they get to the.

131:44 Gary the DM:  You get. Meet them at the forges.

131:46 Gary the DM:  They're kind of cleaning up. Hong is like dousing kind of the fire the forge and.

131:53 Gary the DM:  And young Hong is, you know, battling some Things outside and cleaning up, you know, some of the tools and

131:59 Gary the DM:  placing them up and, you know, aprons and things as you get there.

132:04 Gary the DM:  And young Hung greets you both and does so.

132:12 Gary the DM:  Did you, did you like our gifts?

132:17 Chris as Boone:  They're super cool. They're super cool.

132:20 Chris as Boone:  We just had a quick question.

132:22 Chris as Boone:  Wanted to check back in before you left.

132:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

132:25 Chris as Boone:  You know, we'd asked you to check in with some of your buddies about other information that might help us

132:32 Chris as Boone:  out, your young friends. And wanted to know if you had anything for us before, you know, just in case

132:39 Chris as Boone:  we didn't get to catch up with you tomorrow.

132:42 Gary the DM:  Well, no one said they were going to do anything but attend the festival.

132:47 Gary the DM:  So as far as my friends are concerned, they're hoping to get some good food tomorrow and watch the dance

132:57 Gary the DM:  and have a celebration.

133:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That sounds good. How trustworthy are these friends of yours? We think that others were approached and bribed with 100

133:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  gold pizzas similar to you. How many of your friends would turn that down?

133:21 Gary the DM:  100 gold pieces is a lot.

133:26 Gary the DM:  I don't think they would. It didn't sound like they had anything planned, and I don't know why they would

133:33 Gary the DM:  keep me out of it if they did.

133:40 Gary the DM:  They are excited about the festival tomorrow.

133:43 Gary the DM:  It's something new and different, and everybody will be there, and they're excited to see the show and enjoy the

133:53 Gary the DM:  food.

133:57 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay, that almost seems too easy.

134:03 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. I got nothing else for him.

134:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm suspicious.

134:06 Gary the DM:  Okay.

134:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm suspicious. But I, I, I can't think of any other way to give him an opportunity to tell us

134:13 Braedon as Da Baishan:  the truth.

134:17 Chris as Boone:  All right, well, thank you all.

134:19 Chris as Boone:  Good night.

134:20 Gary the DM:  Sure.

134:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  As we go to Eve, I'll just, I'll lean in, like, real close to the child, like, face to face,

134:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  and maybe growl a little bit.

134:29 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Just be like. And you're sure?

134:32 Gary the DM:  You do What?

134:33 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And I'll be like. And you're sure?

134:37 Gary the DM:  Give me an intimidation check.

134:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We already got the weapons, so, you know, 23.

134:46 Gary the DM:  23. All right. So he, you can see, he steps back and his eyes get big, and he says in

134:53 Gary the DM:  a look, kind of a quivery voice, I'm sure I'm not.

135:00 Gary the DM:  They said nothing. Okay.

135:04 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I believe you.

135:06 Gary the DM:  I, I, they, I asked them if, if they had any plans to do any pranks and if they were

135:13 Gary the DM:  being rewarded by the Yea show family.

135:16 Gary the DM:  And they said no. They all said no.

135:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Okay. Thank you for asking and helping.

135:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We trust you.

135:26 Gary the DM:  Okay.

135:28 Chris as Boone:  And I give a clap on the shoulder to reassure him.

135:32 Gary the DM:  Okay. He, he initially kind of flitches away.

135:36 Gary the DM:  You reach out, but you Tap him.

135:38 Gary the DM:  And he goes. I, I, I think my dad's calling.

135:42 Gary the DM:  I, I probably need to clean up now.

135:44 Chris as Boone:  Yeah. And the unarmed attack on him.

135:47 Chris as Boone:  No, just kidding.

135:51 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Backhand the child. No, we'll let him, we'll let him scamper off.

135:55 Chris as Boone:  Okay.

135:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And we'll head back to the end.

135:57 Gary the DM:  Okay, so you guys get back to the end, regroup with the information that you guys have gathered from those

136:03 Gary the DM:  two storylines. You discuss those as Littlefinger walks in, asks what's.

136:13 Gary the DM:  What's been going on? Oh, things, you know, occurred at the Mourn Dusk Willow and the Dark Woods.

136:24 Gary the DM:  And you guys recap with that.

136:26 Gary the DM:  And we'll end here. As we begin the next morning, the day of the festival, instead of telling.

136:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Littlefinger that it was a bear and two squirrels, just say it was three bears.

136:40 Gary the DM:  Oh, I love it. All right, you definitely tell him it.

136:44 Chris as Boone:  Was three bears and every crossbow bolt struck.

136:48 Chris as Boone:  True.

136:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Everyone.

136:51 Chris as Boone:  I've got a mechanical question, I guess, about healing.

136:56 Chris as Boone:  So it seems like the healing kind of sucks with, like, resting.

136:59 Chris as Boone:  I looked it up and you don't gain a whole lot when you rest.

137:03 Chris as Boone:  So, I mean, can we spend some time tonight just doing medicine checks, healing spells, whatever, to do some stuff

137:10 Chris as Boone:  like that?

137:11 Gary the DM:  Yeah. So you'll get a long rest.

137:13 Gary the DM:  Which is the next one?

137:27 Gary the DM:  Yeah, the shoot.

137:35 Gary the DM:  You have to look that one up.

137:36 Gary the DM:  I remember reading about it. It, it's not Grace.

137:39 Gary the DM:  You don't, you don't get all of your hit points back by resting.

137:45 Gary the DM:  Eight hours.

138:00 Chris as Boone:  Character regains hit points equal to their con modifier minimum one multiplied by their level.

138:05 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, you get not a lot.

138:09 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you get your con modifier after eight hours.

138:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So at higher levels, that, that helps more.

138:16 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But yeah, yeah, I have a plus zero to constitution.

138:23 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's not going to help. One.

138:25 Oded as Ginkgo:  Yeah.

138:27 Chris as Boone:  One point.

138:28 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, I get one point after eight hours, right?

138:31 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

138:31 Oded as Ginkgo:  Can I just, like, use my healer skit? And.

138:37 Gary the DM:  So, so you get so. But you can only do that, like, so many times, right? So every, you spend

138:43 Gary the DM:  10 minutes treating wounds, and then the target is then temporarily immune for one hour.

138:50 Gary the DM:  So I guess technically, after, you know, you could do it three times, you know, so every 70 minutes.

138:58 Gary the DM:  Right. You could try it. So I think technically, if you wanted to, like, you know, I guess metagame it

139:04 Gary the DM:  that way, you would. But essentially it would be a doctor.

139:10 Gary the DM:  Right. So who has medical kits? I think it's just two of three.

139:14 Gary the DM:  We got three people. Okay. So, so yeah, you would be able to doctor three people.

139:21 Gary the DM:  And, and basically I'll say you can.

139:24 Chris as Boone:  Get.

139:27 Gary the DM:  Your normal healing. So your Comp bonus by morning, plus three rounds of 2D8.

139:36 Gary the DM:  So, 68, if you did that, because basically one person could be the doctor for one patient, right? That means,

139:45 Gary the DM:  like, ginkgo, could doc be a doctor for Babishon.

139:50 Gary the DM:  You could be a doctor for.

139:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  A.

139:54 Gary the DM:  Donkey if he was wounded. Right.

139:56 Gary the DM:  Boone, you'd be a doctor for yourself.

139:57 Chris as Boone:  Maybe.

139:58 Gary the DM:  It doesn't say you can't be your.

139:59 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

140:00 Gary the DM:  Enter your own ones.

140:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think only.

140:02 Chris as Boone:  Go ahead and roll our own 68.

140:05 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah, well, I think only Boone and.

140:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  And Donkey took damage, Right?

140:09 Oded as Ginkgo:  Okay, I took some damage.

140:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Oh, all right. Well, I didn't, so.

140:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I'll. I'll heal y'. All.

140:19 Braedon as Da Baishan:  One of y'. All.

140:20 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can. You can heal one.

140:22 Gary the DM:  So, yeah, if you roll 68 and then add your constitution bonus at the end of that.

140:26 Gary the DM:  All right, we'll say that. That's what you guys have at the next morning.

140:33 Chris as Boone:  Cool. Back to full health.

140:39 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Awesome.

140:41 Chris as Boone:  And was. Was Little Finger hurt? I mean, he would heal tonight, too, I guess.

140:47 Chris as Boone:  He's around.

140:48 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

140:50 Gary the DM:  Littlefinger, was he hurt from the war?

140:53 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, he might not have been.

140:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I don't know.

140:57 Gary the DM:  Yeah, he's hurt. He's got 10 hit points now.

141:02 Gary the DM:  I won't be able to. Only he can change it, I think.

141:04 Chris as Boone:  But.

141:07 Braedon as Da Baishan:  We can heal him in the morning.

141:08 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you guys can. Can do him.

141:10 Gary the DM:  We can do the same thing for.

141:11 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Him.

141:13 Gary the DM:  When we start up next time, I guess.

141:16 Gary the DM:  On another mechanical thing, I'm. I'm looking at hero points and doing something with them.

141:21 Gary the DM:  I have a couple interesting ideas.

141:25 Gary the DM:  I need to see how it might work.

141:30 Gary the DM:  And I was trying to do something for each class.

141:31 Gary the DM:  Like, my thought is to, like, use this as a way of each class having another unique kind of thing.

141:39 Gary the DM:  And so I have some ideas.

141:42 Gary the DM:  I just want to see how well that would work.

141:44 Gary the DM:  And so basically what I would do is every session, you'd have this hero point which will allow you to

141:48 Gary the DM:  use. My thought was, like, you could re roll a roll or use your class ability as the hero point.

141:57 Gary the DM:  That's a good idea because I can do something like that just to use those.

142:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So that would help my crossbow.

142:05 Chris as Boone:  It might.

142:06 Gary the DM:  Yeah, you can use that as a re roll.

142:07 Gary the DM:  So, yeah, that's what I think I was thinking of trying to do.

142:12 Gary the DM:  And I had one for, like, wizard that we had, you know, our fighter, Rogue, um, and a cleric as

142:21 Gary the DM:  well. And then one for the investigator I thought would be interesting.

142:24 Gary the DM:  So I'm trying to flesh those out and see maybe someone else has done something like that.

142:28 Gary the DM:  So I was going to look at like, other homebrewed kind of ideas.

142:31 Gary the DM:  All the ones I kind of stole from different game systems.

142:34 Gary the DM:  So I'm trying to, you know, translate them into this.

142:36 Gary the DM:  If they were.

142:39 Chris as Boone:  Yeah, cool.

142:41 Braedon as Da Baishan:  For. For next week. I know I told y' all I'll be in Nashville next week for work.

142:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But we got the schedule. Unfortunately.

142:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They have us scheduled for dinners Wednesday and Thursday night.

142:52 David as Donkey:  Okay.

142:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I may not be able to.

142:55 Braedon as Da Baishan:  To do anything in person after all.

142:57 Gary the DM:  Okay. But yeah, that's cool.

143:01 Braedon as Da Baishan:  They. This is the first time that I get to go to kickoff as not a director.

143:06 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right. So I'm excited about that.

143:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But, man, did they. It's like a full schedule.

143:12 Gary the DM:  Is it? Yeah. If I remember, is it like the global, like, executive here? Yeah.

143:18 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. So this time, because it's a whole new regime.

143:21 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Right. So this time, director plus GO gets stuff on Tuesday.

143:25 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But then all people, leaders, I think manager, senior manager and above can go Wednesday and Thursday.

143:32 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I fly in like Tuesday evening and I'm there through Friday afternoon.

143:36 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But. But they've got us like, fully scheduled.

143:41 Gary the DM:  Yeah.

143:42 Oded as Ginkgo:  What. What are they going to announce? Any idea?

143:46 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It's. I think it's similar to what Gary's done in the past, right.

143:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Where it's. It's the okrs for the.

143:52 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Supposedly we're going back to okrs and KPI's.

143:54 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Thank God. Let's see if we actually do it right.

143:58 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But. So apparently it's like okrs and KPI's for the year.

144:03 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Major initiatives. They will talk about Assurian next, which we're trying to put on our own.

144:09 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Like little showcase things similar to Amazon or Google.

144:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  So I think they'll talk more about that.

144:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm going to use it to recruit for the hackathon that I'm planning because there's nobody else left to plan

144:22 Braedon as Da Baishan:  it. I did last year as I'll do this year's.

144:26 Chris as Boone:  But.

144:26 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. So I don't really know what to expect.

144:30 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Should be interesting.

144:32 Gary the DM:  Well, have fun. See what you said Tuesday through Thursday, but they got all your evenings.

144:37 Gary the DM:  What about in lunches or anything? Like, I'm.

144:40 Chris as Boone:  I'm.

144:40 Gary the DM:  It's gonna be in the Assurian building.

144:42 Gary the DM:  Right. I'm right down the street.

144:43 Gary the DM:  It'd be cool to.

144:44 Chris as Boone:  Yeah.

144:45 Gary the DM:  Lunch or something or even. Even a coffee.

144:47 David as Donkey:  Like.

144:47 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah.

144:48 Gary the DM:  Wednesday morning or something.

144:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I think we could do that.

144:50 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Also Tuesday evening, I land at like 7.

144:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I'm staying at the Tempo Hotel if any of y' all want to meet up for drinks or anything Tuesday.

144:59 Gary the DM:  Okay. Okay, cool. I'll take a look and see.

145:04 Gary the DM:  I'm doing. I. I think I have something too.

145:06 Chris as Boone:  That's.

145:07 Gary the DM:  What, the 18th or something?

145:08 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Wait, 17?

145:10 Gary the DM:  Yeah, let me check. 17 some.

145:11 Gary the DM:  I think I have something then.

145:12 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But that is ma. Gross. I know it's.

145:15 Braedon as Da Baishan:  It's a big holiday, but not for y'.

145:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All.

145:18 Gary the DM:  Yeah, it's not. It's not that.

145:20 Gary the DM:  But. But yeah, let me take a look.

145:22 Gary the DM:  But yeah, let's. Let's text each other something and see, because I said even if I.

145:30 Gary the DM:  I usually get in, I'm in the office there.

145:33 Gary the DM:  I'll be there Tuesday through Thursday in the office in the morning, so.

145:36 Gary the DM:  And I usually get there pretty early.

145:37 Gary the DM:  And my day doesn't really get busy until later.

145:41 Gary the DM:  So, like, if you wanted to do something like 8:30, even like before you go into like a 9am something

145:47 Gary the DM:  just like that Paris baguette right there.

145:49 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love to see y'.

145:53 Braedon as Da Baishan:  All. Yeah. In too long.

145:55 Gary the DM:  My hair is probably almost growing back by then.

145:59 Braedon as Da Baishan:  That's all right. I'll shave. I'll shave the sides of mine beforehand.

146:02 Chris as Boone:  So.

146:02 Gary the DM:  Yeah, mine's pretty fuzzy still. Yeah, cool.

146:08 David as Donkey:  But cool.

146:09 Gary the DM:  We'll meet next week. Well, are you gonna be.

146:11 Gary the DM:  You're not gonna be able to play then Thursday probably, right?

146:14 Braedon as Da Baishan:  Probably not. I'll let you guys know as.

146:17 Braedon as Da Baishan:  As I figure out, like, what Thursday looks like.

146:20 Braedon as Da Baishan:  I imagine Vic is also tentative.

146:23 Gary the DM:  That's right. Yeah. Okay.

146:24 Braedon as Da Baishan:  But, yeah.
