00:00 Gary:  But yeah, we'll do. I've got interest.

00:03 Gary:  I. I have a few things we'll share.

00:05 Gary:  And I put some maps. I don't know if you guys can see.

00:07 Gary:  You can flip back to general, I think, right.

00:10 Gary:  And see the maps that I put in there.

00:14 Gary:  Grayson's gonna color the second one.

00:15 Gary:  She did the first one too.

00:16 Gary:  So I asked her like, kind of just.

00:18 Gary:  I told her a little bit about what I wanted with the town.

00:22 Gary:  And so she created. You can see Willow Shore where you guys will be in inside of that con that

00:28 Gary:  the region of Chuyi is not the like ocean shore.

00:34 Gary:  So not like big ships or anything like that.

00:37 Gary:  It's really along a river. So it's a logging, mining kind of area that used to be around.

00:45 Gary:  So it's at the junction rivers.

00:48 Gary:  The shore. The closest shore would be going to the north.

00:51 Gary:  So the rest of those kind of join in together.

00:53 Gary:  That's a big lake. And to the east there, I'm going to go to the north.

00:58 Gary:  And then there's kind of a little bit more detailed map of what the hella show will be in the

01:03 Gary:  black and white one. But she's going to color that one for me as well.

01:09 Oded Welgreen:  Just a quick. A quick note.

01:11 Oded Welgreen:  I'm. I'm gonna record if that's okay.

01:14 Oded Welgreen:  Don't sue me. And I'll see if I can just summarize it for us and create some notes.

01:21 Gary:  Yeah, that was super, super helpful.

01:24 David:  Yeah, those are fun.

01:26 Braedon:  Love those.

01:27 Gary:  Cool. So. So that's kind of like.

01:31 Gary:  I told her to do a little bit abstract.

01:33 Gary:  The town is, you know, had a heyday and is now kind of a skeleton of its former self.

01:41 Gary:  But I wanted. It's an Asian theme we can talk through.

01:45 Gary:  Like you guys could be from different continents if you don't want to do Asian names or not.

01:48 Gary:  But it is more of a.

01:50 Gary:  An Asian kind of style continent.

01:52 Gary:  Tian Sha is the. The region that this Pathfinder world is in.

01:57 Gary:  And so there's some of that.

01:59 Gary:  The. But part of this I'm going to use.

02:03 Gary:  We'll go through this section here.

02:04 Gary:  So I'll do a kind of a reading that I did for the shore to kind of set us up.

02:09 Gary:  I'll do these. This thing I borrowed from another game I like called Wild Sea.

02:14 Gary:  They have things that they call them unsteady questions.

02:17 Gary:  And basically it will prompt you guys to get your creative hats.

02:21 Gary:  And I don't know if you want vodka or whatever.

02:23 Gary:  It helps to get some creativity rolling.

02:26 Gary:  But I'm gonna ask you guys questions to answer about Willow Shore in the area.

02:31 Gary:  Obviously, you guys don't know the area, but that's the fun of this.

02:34 Gary:  So you guys are gonna have some questions that you can shape what is here and not here, and.

02:40 Gary:  And we'll do that later on when we get to.

02:42 Gary:  After you guys build your characters, we'll do a similar thing for, like, bonding the characters, you know, to each

02:47 Gary:  other. And hopefully it'll be tied a little bit to the region so that when we first start, you guys

02:51 Gary:  feel like this is a place that you've been in for a little while or maybe you're brand new, but

02:56 Gary:  you had a piece of shaping it as we went along, so that's kind of the agenda.

03:01 Gary:  We'll talk a little about Willowshore, let you guys set some, like, unsteady questions for it, me some answers.

03:06 Gary:  I'll take notes on those. We'll do our character building together.

03:10 Gary:  We'll see how that works together.

03:11 Gary:  I'm using demiplane. I saw everybody was in there, so that's great.

03:16 Gary:  We'll talk through that one. We'll talk through what kind of characters you guys want to have and all that

03:20 Gary:  stuff. That'll be the most of the session.

03:22 Gary:  We'll finish up with some bonding questions and then kind of like setting us up for the first session, like,

03:28 Gary:  logistics. What times do we want to play, how often? What happens when people are missing? We'll do a couple

03:33 Gary:  of those things at the end to kind of tidy up and then.

03:36 Gary:  Oh, yeah, sounds good.

03:41 Braedon:  Awesome.

03:42 Gary:  So here's my. My reading voice.

03:44 Gary:  And yes, I did use ChatGPT to clean this up for me, so it's a helpful tool.

03:49 Gary:  I'm gonna. I don't know if you heard about this thing, but it's like taking the world by storm, I

03:54 Gary:  think. Or it should.

03:56 David:  I saw it on the news, but I think it'll fade away like that Internet.

04:00 Gary:  It's not fake news. It's real.

04:02 Gary:  I think just a be around for a bit.

04:05 Gary:  All right.

04:05 David:  Oh, I think so too.

04:07 Braedon:  Yeah, not a phase. Mom.

04:12 Gary:  Can I see you guys again? Like, how do I go? That's cool.

04:15 Gary:  All right. So nestled on the on a slow bend of the rain swollen Yanzy river, the town of Willore

04:22 Gary:  is a place of faded glory and stubborn heart.

04:25 Gary:  Here at the edge of Chi's wild, mysterious forest, old festivals are honored Even as old wounds fester.

04:32 Gary:  Strangers, footsteps are watched, and secrets settle thick as mist along the water's edge.

04:37 Gary:  Tonight, on the eve of autumn, the air is alive with anticipation.

04:42 Gary:  Lanterns flicker, drums thumb. And the whole Town gathers for the ancient festival of returning spirits, set to protect Willow

04:49 Gary:  Shore from whatever haunts the dark woods beyond.

04:53 Gary:  You have been chosen to lead this year's ceremonial play, walk in the shadows as the founders once did, acting

05:00 Gary:  out the fragile bargain that keeps the unknown at bay.

05:04 Gary:  As fires crackle, shadows stretch long.

05:07 Gary:  An uneasy feeling stirs in your bones.

05:09 Gary:  Whispers of a powerful new oni.

05:11 Gary:  Mayor's arrival has already unsettled the town.

05:14 Gary:  But tonight, something stranger still still creeps in.

05:17 Gary:  Mid yellow lantern light and painted mask.

05:20 Gary:  You feel eyes on you from somewhere beyond.

05:23 Gary:  In Willow Shore, the past is never at rest and old powers hunger for attention.

05:30 Gary:  That's the opening theme. And when we do our first adventure, you guys will start with the Founders Festival as

05:37 Gary:  we. As we kick it off for your players.

05:39 Gary:  So I have some questions. I'll post the questions, I think in the.

05:43 Gary:  The general chat and then you guys can all read them.

05:46 Gary:  Definitely talk about answers that you think would be interesting.

05:52 Gary:  And I have, I think four of them.

05:53 Gary:  So this would be the first one.

06:00 Gary:  Oni, if you guys don't know, is really just a demon.

06:03 Gary:  Devil. Demon. It's another term for that in like, I think Japanese culture, maybe Chinese culture.

06:11 Gary:  Be too harsh on me not knowing what cultures are what hopefully won't get in trouble there.

06:16 Gary:  But yeah, so it's basically. It's like a demon.

06:18 Gary:  And remember in R. If you didn't read the setting, Chuyi is actually governed by demons.

06:25 Gary:  These oni. And so this Willow Shore hasn't had a mayor for a long time.

06:31 Gary:  It's just a small little town in kind of the center of nothing.

06:34 Gary:  But now the rumors are that.

06:38 Gary:  That a oni mayor is coming in for the first time in a while, for a long time.

06:42 Gary:  And that has stirred up a lot of commotion and unrest.

06:47 Gary:  When the new mayor arrives, what tradition must be observed to keep the peace? And who in town refuses to

06:52 Gary:  take part?

06:59 Chris:  We typing and talking.

07:01 Gary:  Yeah, type talk. Whatever you. You want to do.

07:04 Gary:  What do you guys have an answer? I want to keep notes of it, but what do you want to

07:09 Gary:  do?

07:09 Vic:  Any information on what happened to the old mayor? Why do we have a new mayor? Was it just election

07:14 Vic:  season? Term limits? What happened?

07:18 Gary:  So it's. It's been many years, like so even like probably a generation issue before, since there was a mayor,

07:27 Gary:  the. The. The town basically kind of went, I would say bankrupt, but just started to get ignored and the

07:38 Gary:  old mayor left many years ago, or it hasn't up until recently, Wilhelm has been kind of allowed to govern

07:46 Gary:  on its own. So they had a local governor and local government.

07:50 Gary:  You guys can decide what kind of government you might want to have.

07:52 Gary:  But that's kind of the history.

07:54 Gary:  So any gaps that you want to villain is free for you guys to do.

08:00 Braedon:  It seems like. Like there's a pretty clear class divide.

08:04 Braedon:  So the first thing that comes to my mind is something like the lower class can't look at the oni

08:11 Braedon:  or can't make eye contact with the only and only the ruling class can like, look.

08:15 Vic:  The owner is definitely taking control.

08:18 Vic:  Right. Like there's a. Over to me at least.

08:22 Vic:  Maybe it's just Braden. Maybe I'm just a terrible person.

08:25 Vic:  I definitely like the way Gary was describing the history.

08:28 Vic:  It's. Oh, so somebody just stepped up to take control of this place now.

08:33 Braedon:  Yeah.

08:34 David:  Yeah.

08:35 Braedon:  I imagine that wouldn't sit well with.

08:40 Vic:  I can't. Can't look at him or have to tithe to him in some way.

08:45 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah. I like the. Like everyone needs to avert their eyes.

08:49 Oded Welgreen:  Maybe. Maybe something about the oni was always there so we.

08:55 Oded Welgreen:  They are not allowed to see them.

08:57 Oded Welgreen:  Like the oni come into town or something.

09:00 Braedon:  Oh, that's a. That's an interesting twist.

09:04 Vic:  1984 ish of it.

09:06 Braedon:  Yeah.

09:12 Vic:  Immediately rewriting the history. I've always been here.

09:14 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, exactly.

09:16 Braedon:  And the whole like averting your gaze was a thing in ancient China as well.

09:20 Braedon:  You were not allowed to look upon the emperor.

09:23 Braedon:  So that kind of fit well, so.

09:25 Gary:  So I wrote down for. For that question.

09:27 Gary:  If you guys like it. I don't know where that's going.

09:34 Gary:  You're not allowed to look on the only as they enter town.

09:37 Gary:  You've always been here. It's kind of sentiment.

09:39 Gary:  So when they're in town, you could look at them.

09:41 Gary:  But entering town. Is that the thing? They have to enter in the.

09:44 Gary:  The town have a main gate.

09:47 Gary:  Like there is a gate at the town.

09:48 Gary:  Even if you accept the drawing there across the bridge.

09:53 Gary:  Is that what you guys want to say? And then who.

09:56 Gary:  Who refused to do it? So who looked upon the new mayor as they entered town?

10:03 Braedon:  Is that.

10:05 Gary:  It does not have to be.

10:06 Gary:  Yeah, it could be. You guys have a greater character.

10:09 Gary:  So you could say we all did or you could say so and so did.

10:13 Gary:  And that means that so and so now exists in this town and will be a part of our story.

10:20 Vic:  Must have a dissenter.

10:23 Braedon:  Or like a dissenting group. Like, because, you know, part of the material says that there's 90% of the population

10:31 Braedon:  don't have a copper to their name.

10:32 Braedon:  Right. So it's Like, I wonder if, like, the poor and destitute care little for the rules of the owning.

10:50 Gary:  David posted. Have you guys read it? Yeah.

10:54 Braedon:  Yeah.

10:54 Gary:  Facto family or rulers refusing to attend the festival.

11:02 Braedon:  I like that. That kind of plays into the.

11:04 Braedon:  The hostile takeover idea too.

11:08 Chris:  Yeah.

11:08 Vic:  If you wanted to. To tie it all together, it's, you.

11:13 Gary:  Know, let's do another one. See, Right.

11:17 Gary:  So we did that one.

11:23 Gary:  All right. This one's another brain twister, I guess.

11:27 Gary:  What is the oldest story? Villagers whisper about the forest shadows.

11:31 Gary:  And why does nobody ever say the story's ending aloud?

11:40 David:  My first thought, because the ending is really lame and stupid and this kind of ruins the story.

11:50 Gary:  Yeah. Why don't they say hello, I guess.

11:54 Braedon:  Or it's like if the. If the.

11:55 Braedon:  The first 80% of the story teaches some moral lesson and the epic invalidates it.

12:01 Gary:  It.

12:01 Braedon:  So no one.

12:05 Vic:  Or their hero dies.

12:07 Braedon:  Yeah.

12:09 Vic:  Yeah. Like, it tells the story of their strength, and then at the end of the story, they all die.

12:14 Vic:  And they're in this destitute village.

12:16 Vic:  Now, I still like to add that part.

12:20 Braedon:  I like that idea of, like, what if.

12:22 Braedon:  It's a story of a party of, you know, people that came together to overthrow the previous ruling class, and

12:31 Braedon:  they. They succeeded, but in the end, they all died.

12:34 Braedon:  And so everyone talks about the good parts.

12:36 Braedon:  They overthrew the ruling class and brought peace to the.

12:40 Braedon:  To the town. And no one talks about how they all actually died or did they?

12:48 David:  And they live happily ever after.

12:49 Gary:  End of story.

12:59 David:  So about the forest shadows. So what if I.

13:05 David:  What that makes me think of is, like, Will O Wisps.

13:09 David:  And like, spirits who will lead you astray in the woods or make you get lost in the woods.

13:18 David:  And maybe there's a. There's a warning story about this guy who got led away by the Will O wisps

13:24 David:  or whatever they are, and it turns out he was just really drunk and got lost.

13:33 Braedon:  Now, that's character inspiration.

13:39 Braedon:  Someone can play as a drunkard.

13:43 Vic:  But I like that. But it happens more, like, often than you would think, Right? They whisper this story about

13:51 Vic:  willow wisps that lead random villagers off.

13:55 Vic:  And, you know, maybe they are just getting drunk.

13:58 Vic:  But then the part they don't say is that something terrible happens to the people.

14:05 Vic:  I don't know. I don't necessarily need something terrible to happen to anybody, I guess, but I.

14:10 David:  Yeah, well, I mean, people get lost in forests and nobody knows why.

14:14 David:  I think that's probably why scary stories about the woods exist, to keep kids from doing it.

14:19 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah.

14:20 Gary:  Is this.

14:20 Braedon:  Is this how parents talk about drinking and partying without their kids knowing that's what they're actually talking about.

14:27 Braedon:  It's the willow wisps led me away last night.

14:30 Braedon:  That's why I didn't come home.

14:35 Braedon:  Pass that on the street. So we.

14:37 Vic:  We have a village off its heyday, surrounded by forest shadows.

14:44 Vic:  Is there. Is there.

14:46 Gary:  There, there.

14:48 Vic:  Elders from a time gone by.

14:50 Vic:  Are those the forest shadows?

14:55 David:  It could be that as the population, like, as the commerce in the city waned and jobs started to go

15:01 David:  away, more and more of the population move to a more agrarian lifestyle for like hunter gatherer type out in

15:09 David:  the surrounding woods. And I don't know how long ago this would have been, but there could definitely be.

15:21 Braedon:  Is this the Appalachian Hill people of this realm? No one talks that they actually exist, but they do.

15:29 Braedon:  And they were just displaced. Now they're.

15:31 Braedon:  Now they're farmers. Yeah.

15:36 David:  The factory closed down and now they just hunt.

15:41 Braedon:  God, that sounds great.

15:44 Gary:  Why.

15:45 Vic:  Why wouldn't they finish that story then?

15:51 David:  Yeah, it's the end where it's awesome.

15:53 David:  It just gives one a good luck.

15:57 Chris:  I like the idea of them disagreeing, people disagreeing, you know, so some person says, no, that's not how it

16:02 Chris:  ends it. And it doesn't end like that at all.

16:04 Chris:  So we have these, like, competing stories.

16:07 Braedon:  That's a good idea. Yeah. No one says the ending because no one can agree on the ending.

16:14 Braedon:  Everyone's got their own.

16:15 Oded Welgreen:  All right. I bet.

16:19 Braedon:  Great idea.

16:23 David:  Yeah. I mean, if nobody ever says the ending out loud, it's pretty likely that nobody knows the ending.

16:29 David:  Or, like, they'll ask each other privately and they might lie to say something that suits their purposes in the

16:37 David:  moment. And multiple endings, possibly with different morals, probably exist.

16:45 David:  Like if you ask your friends at school, hey, what's the ending of this story? My mom won't tell me.

16:49 David:  They'll probably say something.

16:51 Braedon:  What if it's in that vein? Like, what if it's such a critical story to the culture that no one

16:58 Braedon:  can say they're disparate endings because it starts fights, it drives people apart.

17:02 Braedon:  Right. And so you don't say the ending because you don't want to anger anyone else because it doesn't match

17:09 Braedon:  their perceived idea of the ending.

17:11 Oded Welgreen:  It's like talking about politics.

17:13 Vic:  Yeah.

17:14 David:  Yeah. I was thinking heretical, but kind of the same thing.

17:18 Braedon:  Right. And maybe that's the backstory of the oni.

17:27 Oded Welgreen:  That's what.

17:30 Braedon:  Nobody knows.

17:30 Oded Welgreen:  Nobody knows.

17:32 Braedon:  It's inherently politics and it's divisive, so no one talks about it.

17:36 Braedon:  For fear of angering each other.

17:41 Oded Welgreen:  But they secretly blame each other.

17:45 David:  Oh, so. So maybe the. The ending of the story is something embarrassing for the de facto family.

17:55 David:  And everybody knows the ending. Like, you know what happened, but you're not allowed to say it because if you

18:02 David:  say it, then they'll target you somehow, possibly violently.

18:06 Vic:  I like that. What are the foreshadows in the first half of that for you then? I like that ending.

18:11 Vic:  I like that one a lot.

18:14 Braedon:  I think the foreshadows could still be kind of what caused the downfall of the.

18:19 Braedon:  Of the de facto ruling family.

18:21 Braedon:  Right. And why the oni has to come in.

18:24 Braedon:  Something lured them away and corrupted them.

18:27 David:  Yeah.

18:29 Vic:  And opened them up to the oni.

18:32 Vic:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:34 Oded Welgreen:  Okay.

18:34 Vic:  Somebody's got to say it all together now.

18:36 Gary:  I don't remember it all.

18:38 Chris:  It's embarrassing for them. And I think that sets up really well.

18:40 Chris:  Like, some people love that the oni came in.

18:44 Chris:  They don't like the de facto rulers.

18:46 Chris:  Some people, obviously, the only came in.

18:49 Chris:  And so, you know, we have these factions already.

18:51 Braedon:  I love that. Yeah, you got it.

18:54 Braedon:  Gary's got it all put together.

18:55 Braedon:  He knows.

18:56 Gary:  I don't know. I got it, folks.

18:57 Gary:  But yeah, last one is.

19:10 Gary:  Cool. I don't know if I have.

19:13 Gary:  I have the gist of it.

19:14 Gary:  I don't know if I.

19:14 David:  What.

19:15 Gary:  I'll. It'll piece together into the.

19:21 Oded Welgreen:  Story.

19:21 Gary:  But do we want to keep the.

19:24 Gary:  So the wisp lead folks into the shadows of the forest.

19:31 Gary:  What happened? We had initially that they were.

19:34 Gary:  Because they were drunk. Are we getting rid of that and going with that? Whatever happened.

19:44 David:  Sorry, go ahead.

19:46 Gary:  We had too many fights start.

19:48 Gary:  That's why no one says the ending.

19:49 Gary:  But we're going with that. The ending actually embarrasses the current, the de facto ruling family, and that's why no

19:57 Gary:  one speaks at the end of it.

20:00 Gary:  However, under the covers, there are some folks who, I guess, side with the family and folks who don't and

20:08 Gary:  are actually happy that this oni is coming in to change rulership.

20:15 David:  You could tie them together. If it's one of the ruling family members, like the.

20:19 David:  The heir to the fortune wandered off into the forest.

20:25 David:  And the official story from the family is, you know, he was.

20:31 David:  He was lured by these spirits.

20:33 David:  And maybe. Maybe they are on some sort of crusade to rid the forest of these spirits because of it.

20:43 David:  And it turns out, no, they're just, you know, expats who moved into the forest because there weren't any jobs.

20:50 David:  They're just like us.

20:58 David:  And it turns Out. The guy wound up in the forest just because he had gotten really drunk in the

21:02 David:  bar and lost his way home.

21:07 Braedon:  Gambling.

21:08 David:  And maybe his dad's a teetotaler.

21:10 David:  Maybe that's why he had to spin this yarn.

21:25 Gary:  Okay, cool.

21:31 Gary:  All right, last one, and then we'll get to you guys creating your characters for this.

21:35 Gary:  This crazy world.

21:50 Unknown:  All right.

21:50 Gary:  Someone in Willowshore always smiles, even when the news is bad.

21:54 Gary:  What do they say when they think no one is listening?

21:59 Braedon:  I think the low hanging fruit would be a member of the former Roland family who is happy to hear

22:06 Braedon:  that things aren't going great now that they've been deposed.

22:12 Braedon:  O.

22:12 Oded Welgreen:  That's good. David.

22:15 Gary:  What?

22:15 Braedon:  David.

22:17 Gary:  Oh, nice.

22:22 Gary:  Yeah, I like that. You want to go with I know the real ending.

22:27 Gary:  Or I was there.

22:29 Vic:  You could, Braden. You could still make it part of the former ruling family.

22:32 Vic:  That does it.

22:32 Gary:  And.

22:33 Vic:  But that's what they're saying, what David says there.

22:35 Vic:  Yeah.

22:36 Braedon:  Yeah.

22:36 David:  Oh, yeah.

22:37 Braedon:  I think that fits in, right? Like, they're happy when the oni isn't doing well, or things aren't going great,

22:45 Braedon:  and they're smiling when it's bad news because they know what really happened.

22:48 Braedon:  They were there.

22:50 Vic:  Did we say. Did we say what year this was? What range of years this was? Like, what time Ram,

22:56 Vic:  we're talking here.

22:57 Gary:  We don't. What. What would you like it to be?

23:03 Vic:  You're not supposed to answer a question with a question, Gary.

23:11 Vic:  You threw me off, and all I thought was to attack.

23:13 Vic:  I'm sorry.

23:13 Oded Welgreen:  I'm sorry.

23:18 Braedon:  All the leadership books say to answer every question with a question.

23:22 Gary:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm aware.

23:24 Vic:  Open ended one as well. Right, Exactly.

23:26 Vic:  Like he did.

23:29 Chris:  So the text. So thinking back to, like, when time stopped for me, around the year.

23:35 Chris:  I don't know, like, it's still the year 2000.

23:38 Chris:  So, like, what if, like, everything happened 25, 30 years ago? Something like that.

23:44 Chris:  Or at least that's when the town started, you know, down this path and the ruling family took over.

23:50 Chris:  Or did they take over before that?

23:52 Gary:  I don't know why, but that's way.

23:54 Vic:  More modern than I had in mind.

23:55 Gary:  Like.

23:58 Chris:  Okay, so it was on the opposite.

24:00 Vic:  Very opposite end of the spectrum.

24:02 Chris:  Like, what were you thinking, like, hundreds of years?

24:06 David:  I mean, I was. I had in mind, like, standard high fantasy mishmash.

24:11 Braedon:  Yeah.

24:14 Chris:  Wait, are y' all talking about.

24:16 Chris:  I'm just talking about how long ago the.

24:19 Chris:  How long it's been since the oni were there, how long the ruling family's been ruling the town or something.

24:24 Gary:  Oh, yeah.

24:26 Chris:  Like technology 30 years ago or something.

24:28 Braedon:  Oh no, no.

24:29 Chris:  I mean I was thinking technology.

24:30 Vic:  I was thinking I would like both answers.

24:31 Vic:  Like I was like both. I was both.

24:34 Vic:  I hadn't thought of the one you just brought up before.

24:36 Vic:  I'm worried about it now too though.

24:39 Chris:  I mean technology, I don't know, like feudal Japan maybe.

24:42 Chris:  They're sort of, you know. Are there some modern things being invented? Possibly.

24:48 David:  I like the idea of cell phones having just come out.

24:52 David:  Like only rich people have cell phones.

24:56 Gary:  I think we have cell phones.

25:00 Chris:  Oh.

25:00 David:  So Gary, I had an idea for a setting that I'm almost never going to use, but I think it

25:05 David:  would be fun. It's like roughly classical era technology, but some Euclid Einstein level genius discovers semiconductors and figures out

25:17 David:  how to make logic gates. But there aren't any means of power generation.

25:22 David:  So you have these huge hand cranked things that do one operation every 10 seconds or so.

25:31 Braedon:  It's like the fallout world. All we have is seven actors.

25:39 Gary:  Sounds like that'd be a good book.

25:40 Gary:  I don't know if I want to play a setting but.

25:46 David:  It would be a good book.

25:48 David:  I have tried. I've gotten very little written.

25:56 Gary:  So for time window, like except for the time since a ONI led Willow Shore has been generations, just a

26:05 Gary:  few generations.

26:11 Vic:  I like Chris's time range there.

26:12 Vic:  20, 25 years, something like that too too.

26:15 Vic:  I hadn't thought of it this way, but time really did stop at 2000.

26:18 Gary:  I hadn't really thought of that until.

26:20 Vic:  He said that and I was like holy, that's true.

26:25 Vic:  I've been watching sitcoms from them and they're all talking about the same things that are happening now.

26:28 Vic:  So I like that range and technology level.

26:32 Vic:  I. I think we've really discussed that one too much.

26:37 Gary:  At least for the setting. The.

26:39 Gary:  It's. It'll be like I guess classic style arcade weapons with magic.

26:45 Gary:  There is gunpowder, so but it's fairly rare, primitive.

26:51 Gary:  Only a few folks have it.

26:54 Gary:  But it's not like steampunk for sure yet or anything like that.

26:58 Gary:  So they're kind of mainly a DD fan.

27:02 Gary:  You know what fantasy setting with magic, mythical creatures, archaic weapons, bows, crossbows, swords and things.

27:13 Gary:  And there are a few gunpowder type things.

27:15 Gary:  And I guess there's an artificer class which kind of gets like the ability to create kind of a construct

27:24 Gary:  style thing. So you can like maybe get like an automaton type of thing but more of a familiar type

27:32 Gary:  of creature that could battle from.

27:33 Gary:  So we'll say that. All right.

27:35 Gary:  Okay. So do we have that time window? We got the three questions.

27:40 Gary:  We can work those in. Thanks for playing along.

27:44 Gary:  Hopefully it's a little bit of fun.

27:47 Gary:  I think what we'll do next is if you guys have Demi Plane open, you can kind of start it

27:53 Gary:  and you have to create a character from within the campaign.

27:57 Gary:  So if you go to. I think I saw everybody was in there.

28:02 Gary:  So if you go to. Sometimes it's a little slow, but.

28:09 Braedon:  Go.

28:09 Gary:  To games Pathfinder 2, you should have your campaign invite where you guys can be there.

28:17 Gary:  We click on the Dynasties Ashenwood campaign.

28:20 Gary:  You should have a. Oh, there you go.

28:22 Gary:  A create button. If you haven't started already.

28:24 Gary:  It looks like a few people did.

28:26 Gary:  So if you guys want to start first kind of debating or talking about what kind of characters you each

28:32 Gary:  want to play to see what kind of party mix you have.

28:36 Gary:  And then we'll go through kind of step by step a little bit.

28:39 Gary:  It's fairly easy to get through, but we'll go through steps in case people have some issues or problems with

28:44 Gary:  it. I'll tell you one, a couple things about the setting.

28:48 Gary:  I tried to give some information that's different than D and D, especially the latest D and D that we

28:52 Gary:  played. D&D 5th Edition healing was much easier.

28:58 Gary:  Everybody could heal at a pretty high, high rate.

29:01 Gary:  Having a cleric was I guess for healing was less important because you had short rest, long rest where you

29:06 Gary:  heal all your damage over a long rest.

29:09 Gary:  Pathfinder does not do that. So Pathfinder natural healing is very, very slow.

29:18 Gary:  You don't. If you do a long rest, you actually don't heal all of your wounds back.

29:22 Gary:  You can do medicine checks with skills.

29:25 Gary:  And so skills every single skill has.

29:29 Gary:  And this could be combat skills, activity skills like, you know, even knowledge skills go from untrained, trained, expert, mastery,

29:39 Gary:  legend, I think legendary. And so each one has a rank even like your sword skills will do that too.

29:46 Gary:  But there is a medicine skill untrained you can do barely treat ones.

29:52 Gary:  If you're training that skill, it opens up to be able to treat wounds actually heal with like a healer's

29:56 Gary:  kit, you know, naturally. And you can heal a little bit more there.

30:01 Gary:  But otherwise a cleric that has the heal domain is the one that can heal the most damage.

30:09 Gary:  So that's one thing that you guys may want to think about that you'll need.

30:14 Gary:  You probably want. It's not a necessity.

30:16 Gary:  But if everybody wants to play fires, we can do that too.

30:19 Gary:  But healing just understand healing is not as universally with ease like it was in D&D, 5th Edition D& D

30:28 Gary:  in the past. It's closer to.

30:30 Gary:  Actually closer to what Vic played in the 80s.

30:34 Gary:  DD was very much like only clerics can heal.

30:37 Gary:  Pathfinder is not quite like that, but it feels leaning toward that, that the healer of the party isn't a

30:44 Gary:  cleric or a druid. Primarily the cleric.

30:47 Gary:  They have the most ability to heal.

30:50 Gary:  Healing by resting overnight is not going to get you back your full hit points.

30:59 Gary:  I don't know if anybody has thought about it and wants to say, like, what kind of character they want

31:03 Gary:  to play on a. We'll start with Braden.

31:05 Gary:  Your window happened to be open right now.

31:07 Gary:  Braden, you thought about what you want to do?

31:09 Chris:  A little bit.

31:10 Braedon:  When I was doing research, I was.

31:13 Braedon:  I was drawn to. I think it's the investigator class.

31:16 Braedon:  I haven't picked an ancestry, but I think I'm gonna return a little bit towards my Oberon.

31:24 Oded Welgreen:  Just say Inquisitor.

31:27 Braedon:  Yeah, well, yeah. So, like, you guys know I like to tend to play these.

31:31 Braedon:  These classes work. I can give it some character.

31:34 Braedon:  Right. So I'm leaning towards the investigator where it's not all attack or anything, but it can be fun outside

31:41 Braedon:  of combat.

31:46 Braedon:  But yeah. And I have no idea for ancestry or background yet.

31:50 Gary:  Okay. And when we get the backgrounds, we'll have to.

31:53 Gary:  There's a couple things I don't like about Demiplane right off the bat, which is I know why they do

31:59 Gary:  it, right? They want you to buy things to unlock them.

32:02 Gary:  But I wanted to have a setting to just show me the stuff that you guys can select.

32:07 Gary:  But right now it's like intermingled, even if they put them first or something.

32:11 Gary:  But now a lot of times it's intermingled alphabetically with everything else.

32:14 Gary:  So only the things that are selectable in there and they're like.

32:17 Gary:  It's intermixed with all the other options that the entire Pathfinder world can have and they want you to click

32:23 Gary:  on it to buy those. And I don't want to do that.

32:25 Gary:  It'd be great to filter them out.

32:27 Gary:  All right, so Braden, awesome Investigator.

32:30 Gary:  How about. We'll go, folks. I played before.

32:32 Gary:  How about. David, do you have any ideas?

32:36 David:  I've been debating between a wizard and a cleric.

32:41 David:  Or like bard cleric.

32:50 David:  Yeah, I could do either, depending on what other people want to do.

32:55 Gary:  One other thing you reminded me of one other thing I want to mention.

32:57 Gary:  I think it was in the notes too.

32:58 Gary:  But there is no real multiclassing in Pathfinder.

33:04 Gary:  You are primary class and you can do an archetype, which is like a mixin from another class, which gives

33:12 Gary:  you some feats and abilities from that class, but it's much more limited than what D and D had for

33:19 Gary:  multiclassing. So you can kind of mix in other things.

33:22 Gary:  And when you do that, you have to take what they call a dedication feat.

33:25 Gary:  You're dedicated to that class for a while, and you have to take the next 2ft options from that class,

33:31 Gary:  and then you're free to do anything you want after that.

33:34 Gary:  So they have a little bit of a rule for.

33:36 Gary:  For that. Not sure if they did it.

33:38 Gary:  It was more mechanical for like preventing mid maxing or something else, but.

33:42 Gary:  But that's how they do that.

33:43 Gary:  So the one thing though is there's a lot of, like, subclasses and tons of feats and options to steer

33:48 Gary:  your character the way you want to.

33:50 Gary:  But if you're thinking of doing like a fighter wizard or something like that, you can still do that.

33:55 Gary:  You can start with a fighter or a wizard, and then when you get second level, during second or third

34:00 Gary:  level, you can take that dedication feat, which will allow you to mix in some of those other abilities, but

34:05 Gary:  you won't have all the options that the full class player would have.

34:09 Gary:  Gotcha. Odette, do you have any ideas?

34:15 Oded Welgreen:  I was thinking about an inventor or.

34:21 Oded Welgreen:  Or like a healer or a swashbuckler.

34:26 Oded Welgreen:  I'm happy to do Healer if no one else wants to do it.

34:35 Gary:  Vic, did you have any.

34:38 Vic:  I'm bouncing between. So I wasn't sure if all of the options of classes were options, so I mainly looked

34:45 Vic:  at Place Player Core and Player Core two.

34:49 Vic:  And then.

34:54 Gary:  Oh, no, there's.

34:56 Vic:  Yeah. Well, then Braden jumped out with the guns and Gears one, and so now I don't know if I've

35:00 Vic:  got more options, but I. Similar to Braden's reason, I was thinking Rogue, so I could steal stuff and sneak

35:07 Vic:  up on people and run some cons and stuff like that.

35:09 Vic:  Like, you know, like.

35:13 Braedon:  That's very fitting. Very little finger of you.

35:16 Vic:  Yeah.

35:19 Gary:  The Investigator is a Player Core two, I think.

35:23 Gary:  So I don't think that's a.

35:25 Gary:  A Guns and Gear one or might be in both, but I'm pretty sure Investigators in is available.

35:30 Vic:  Inventor is right above Investigator, so I probably read that one wrong and then just sue me.

35:37 Gary:  I think Inventor's also in there too, but I could be wrong.

35:40 Gary:  There's a lot of classes, you see.

35:43 Gary:  I said, Chris, would you. What'd you think?

35:46 Chris:  I was thinking I was just curious about the Champion thing, which is sort of like a Pathfinder Paladin.

35:55 Chris:  If we do need healing, I think there's some healing ability there.

35:59 Chris:  The champion, like lay on hands type thing at least.

36:03 Chris:  Also just looking at straight up fighter, supposed to be really exciting, like a little more exciting in Pathfinder than

36:09 Chris:  it is in D and D edition.

36:15 Chris:  And then you know, cleric if we need.

36:17 Chris:  If we needed a straight up cleric.

36:19 Chris:  But yeah, maybe champion or fighter.

36:23 Braedon:  And historically we've accidentally either done parties of like all fighter classes or.

36:30 Braedon:  Or no fighter classes. Neither. Neither of them work great, but they've been fun.

36:37 Gary:  We can tell good story. Well, sounds like folks are mixed up on a couple, which is great.

36:45 Gary:  It looks like we have a pretty good mix of folks who are looking spellcasters, non spellcasters as well.

36:52 Gary:  I'll get to, I guess before you guys pick, we'll go through like then you guys pick, you know, name.

36:59 Gary:  I guess right now we don't have names.

37:00 Gary:  Unless you have an idea for a name.

37:02 Gary:  I would just fill in like your name right now until you get to the end.

37:05 Gary:  So that's the first thing you have to select when we get to spells.

37:09 Gary:  For folks who are spellcasters, this is another thing.

37:11 Gary:  I want to let you guys know that it was very different than indeed, especially later D and early in

37:18 Gary:  dd. It's like this, but the spells are.

37:26 Gary:  Each spell that you have memorized goes away literally.

37:31 Gary:  So. So for example, if I want to cast two healing spells before resting, I have to memorize two healing

37:39 Gary:  stones. I don't have like in D D where they have like, oh, I have a library of spells and

37:45 Gary:  I have slots. They got, they got rid of all that.

37:47 Gary:  Just said, look, you're just gonna have spells listed in like, you know, a list.

37:53 Gary:  These are the ones that you have memorized.

37:55 Gary:  If you want to cast more than one, just memorize it twice, three times.

38:00 Gary:  It's a little bit more strategic because you can't.

38:03 Gary:  You may not have like a higher level spell because you only memorized it once and you cast it already.

38:07 Gary:  So you can't use a spell slot.

38:09 Gary:  You know, that would. Cantrips, just like in D and D can be cast as much as you want there

38:14 Gary:  at will. But first level and higher, there's your spell slot is the spell.

38:20 Gary:  So when you cast it, that spell slot is gone.

38:23 Gary:  So if you want to cast the same spell twice, you got to memorize it twice.

38:27 Gary:  You want to cast different spells, obviously memorize two different ones.

38:30 Gary:  But that, that is something new and different in Pathfinder than D and D.

38:34 Gary:  Like I said, that throws back to the old D and D that, you know, Vic was playing in the

38:38 Gary:  80s, so you probably didn't even know what that was.

38:40 Gary:  Different. Cool. So if you guys start with.

38:45 Gary:  I think, like I said, the first thing is you have to select a name.

38:48 Gary:  If you have a name, obviously fill it in.

38:50 Gary:  That'd be great. If you don't fill in your name now because you can edit that later.

38:56 Gary:  And then the next thing you have to select, I believe, is your ancestry.

39:03 Gary:  There are quite a few ancestries.

39:17 Gary:  There's a lot of ancestries. You should be able to see the ones that are available.

39:21 Gary:  Anyone that is selectable, you guys can play.

39:24 Gary:  There are any. Basically of these races could be in this area.

39:29 Gary:  This continent is. There's another continent where like a lot of the other races, like elves fled here.

39:36 Gary:  So they'd be here. There's a couple that I.

39:40 Gary:  That might be more rare, but definitely could be part of the story.

39:45 Gary:  So.

39:50 Gary:  Thank you, Slay.

39:53 Braedon:  One thing that stuck in my brain as I was reading the.

39:57 Braedon:  The materials you talk about the Kitsune.

40:02 Gary:  Yeah.

40:02 Braedon:  Would. Would there be an option to play a human that's actually a Kitsune?

40:08 Gary:  So technically there definitely is, but I didn't want to spend 40 bucks because the only thing I wanted was

40:16 Gary:  the Kitsune out of the book that that comes from.

40:22 Vic:  So.

40:24 Gary:  No. But yes, I guess so.

40:29 Gary:  The. The.

40:33 Gary:  Yeah. But yeah, technically there is.

40:34 Gary:  There definitely is. And you see it's selectable, but.

40:38 Gary:  Or it's not selectable, but it's viable from this Lost Omen's Ancestry Lore book or something like that, which has

40:46 Gary:  tons of ancestries that I didn't really want.

40:49 Gary:  I really did want the Kitsune, but there was no way to get it from anywhere.

40:53 Gary:  I was hoping to get it from like one of the TN Shop books, but it wasn't available.

41:01 Braedon:  Okay, no worries.

41:03 Gary:  Yeah. And then once you select one of these races, like I'll do like a trip key, so I'll be

41:12 Gary:  a frog person. The one thing that's nice is all the details about them are listed before you select them

41:18 Gary:  and you can hover over the links and things.

41:22 Gary:  Typically.

41:26 Gary:  Your race gives you attribute boost.

41:28 Gary:  And we're going to do the default attribute boost, which basically means the ones that are listed are the ones

41:33 Gary:  you get and then the free ones are the ones you can select any of.

41:38 Gary:  And that gives you your pluses on your attributes.

41:41 Gary:  Pathfinder works a lot like D and D attribute gives you pluses, your skill based, you know, gives you pluses,

41:47 Gary:  and then you roll a D20 to see if you're successful or not.

41:50 Gary:  You add those all together, and if you hit the target number or above, you're successful.

41:57 Oded Welgreen:  So whatever. Whatever says unlock next to it.

42:00 Oded Welgreen:  I can't choose it, right?

42:02 Gary:  Yeah. If you click on it, you could see how to buy it if you wanted to.

42:06 Gary:  But yeah, there's a decent number of ancestries, I think, and each ancestry has like a sub or feats that

42:19 Gary:  are off of it. You'll see that when you select them.

42:22 Gary:  Like, I'll do a Cat folk, which is like a Tabaxi.

42:26 Gary:  It's like Cat Folk. You'll see that I'll have several options after that, which heritage I want, which ancestry feats.

42:37 David:  Are there any custom lores that I might know?

42:42 Gary:  Yes. So. So the lore. Are you at the skill? I'm guessing you're at skills.

42:48 Gary:  Yeah. So I had. I created a big list.

42:51 Gary:  So lore is a very wide open skill.

42:55 Gary:  It can be almost anything. But what you want to know about maybe get plus there.

42:58 Gary:  So it's like a, you know, what you've researched.

43:01 Gary:  So I have a bunch of them.

43:03 Gary:  I'll list out a few of them here that would be close to like willowshore.

43:07 Gary:  So like Chuyi lore. Willowshore lore.

43:15 David:  Yeah. I think I might be willowshore lore, because I think so my character is gonna be like, super old.

43:21 David:  Nobody knows how old he is, but he clearly looks old.

43:26 David:  And so one of the things that he does is just he knows everybody.

43:31 David:  He knows, you know, how people are related.

43:33 David:  He knows their. Who their parents are, knows where they live.

43:37 Gary:  Okay.

43:38 David:  Like he's just been around the town forever.

43:41 Gary:  Yeah. So I did will of show more.

43:43 Gary:  I did oni lore. Oni politics I thought would be a good one.

43:48 Gary:  Festival lore, mass maker lore. Because there's mass and other things.

43:54 Gary:  Spirit lore and spirits was a key thing in Chuyi and actually missing ghosts.

44:01 Gary:  The forest lore could be a good one.

44:06 Gary:  Lost dynasties. So there's several other ones, but yeah.

44:11 Gary:  So almost anything you can think of.

44:12 Gary:  You could be a specialist and you could pick like, other things too.

44:15 Gary:  You know, if you want it to be about the royal families or, you know, politics.

44:21 Gary:  You can even take a general politics one.

44:23 Gary:  Oh, that might be a little bit too broad, but yeah.

44:29 Gary:  I don't know. Is everybody. Everybody pick an ancestry? Be interesting to see what.

44:34 Gary:  What you picked. So, David, you're sounds like you're a little bit ahead, but what.

44:38 Gary:  What is your old person? Is it an old man? Is it an old.

44:43 Gary:  Old drifty? Like, what is he?

44:47 David:  I think old human.

44:49 Gary:  All right. Cool. I'm.

44:53 Braedon:  This is gonna be weird, but also very me.

44:56 Braedon:  I think I'm leaning towards an Orc.

45:00 Oded Welgreen:  Okay.

45:01 Gary:  Yeah.

45:02 Braedon:  Pathfinder doesn't make them as stupid as.

45:05 Braedon:  As DND does.

45:07 Gary:  Yeah.

45:09 Vic:  I once described you an orcish to somebody that fits.

45:11 Gary:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

45:13 Chris:  That's kind of what.

45:14 David:  I guess. One question I would have about picking my race is what is the racial makeup of Willowshore?

45:23 Gary:  The actual town?

45:25 Chris:  Yeah.

45:25 Gary:  Yeah. I guess that depends a little bit.

45:29 Gary:  Humans would be the more dominant race with sprinkled in of.

45:35 Gary:  Of several others. Probably like Cat Folk would be in there.

45:40 Gary:  Dwarves would be very rare, but there could be some Elves.

45:46 Gary:  The. What about halflings? Halflings running around there? Halflings could be around, yeah.

45:51 Gary:  Halflings run around. Gnomes and goblins would be around.

45:54 Gary:  Hobgoblins. Humans. Leshy could be in there too, if you want to be like a.

46:00 Gary:  A, A vegetable person. Lizard folk? Rat folk? Yeah, pretty much.

46:06 Gary:  Kind of have fun with what you want to play.

46:10 Gary:  You might be a pretty small minority.

46:12 Gary:  Like, you might be the only one.

46:14 Gary:  Like, maybe that's part of the story and that's fine too.

46:17 Oded Welgreen:  So.

46:18 Gary:  Yeah.

46:19 Oded Welgreen:  Vika, are you going with a halfling?

46:23 Vic:  I'm going with the halfling Rogue, I believe.

46:25 Vic:  Yeah.

46:25 Oded Welgreen:  Okay.

46:26 Gary:  Classic halfling.

46:27 Vic:  Halflings get a dexterity bonus, and that's my key trait.

46:30 Vic:  And so I was limiting myself to ones that only got a dexterity charity bonus.

46:35 Vic:  And it came to. To the Rat Folk or the Halfling.

46:39 Vic:  And I thought a halfling named Littlefinger made more sense than a rat named Littlefinger, so.

46:48 Chris:  Or is this kind of a dwarf free?

46:50 Vic:  Maybe because you can only have one halfling.

46:52 Gary:  That wouldn't be.

46:53 Vic:  That would be weird though, right?

46:53 Gary:  You could.

46:55 David:  I mean, if it was good enough for Lord of the Rings, I feel.

46:57 Gary:  Like we should be able to do it.

47:00 Vic:  So when you select the halfling, too.

47:02 Vic:  I didn't know this. I now have to select three different, like, halfling Heritage and ancestry.

47:07 Vic:  Feet and ancestry boosts. And there's some really interesting stuff in here.

47:11 Gary:  Everybody has that. Every single race has those same three combos.

47:15 Gary:  Chris. Dwarves, I think.

47:17 Chris:  Oh, yeah. Are we doing no Dwarves or they're just rare?

47:21 Gary:  They're pretty rare in this whole continent.

47:23 Gary:  So if you want to be a dwarf, what we would probably say is you're definitely like an outsider and

47:30 Gary:  maybe a recent traveler to the area because there's.

47:34 Gary:  In the whole Tian Sha, like, continent, Dwarves are very rare, very rare.

47:41 Chris:  Oh, I love that. I love that.

47:42 Chris:  Okay. I'm an outsider.

47:43 Braedon:  I'm a dwarf.

47:45 Chris:  It's like the Old west, you know, I've come in and just a stranger.

47:53 Vic:  I would expect questions from the locals, maybe even some ostracization.

48:01 Vic:  I'm not sure if that's a word.

48:08 Gary:  We got a human, an orc dwarf, halfling.

48:14 Oded Welgreen:  I'm gonna go with a Leshy.

48:16 Gary:  Leshy.

48:17 Vic:  All right, great.

48:18 Gary:  In the Lessian. All right, cool.

48:20 Gary:  Yeah. Like I said, after you guys choose that, you'll see that you'll get a similar thing.

48:26 Gary:  Like there's a heritage which is like a sub race kind of focuses on what your, your race might be.

48:33 Gary:  There's several things there. The interesting is ancestry feats, Pathfinder, everything's in feats and they just kind of categorize them,

48:43 Gary:  but they use the same technique for everything.

48:45 Gary:  So as you level up, you'll get an opportunity to get a new ancestry feature which is something that's, you

48:51 Gary:  know, more in line with what you're doing.

48:53 Gary:  So like Leshy has like, you know, hey, are you a plant made primarily of fruit or elise or gourds?

49:02 Gary:  Right. And that gives you special abilities?

49:05 Oded Welgreen:  Obviously a fungus. Obviously.

49:10 Gary:  Obviously seaweed or vine. The. And then, yeah, then you have the ancestry feet.

49:17 Gary:  And then the ancestry boosts are.

49:19 Gary:  You'll see. We're gonna do the default option for everybody, which means your ancestry dictates two of them and then

49:26 Gary:  you generally get one free one.

49:28 Gary:  If you go the other route, which we won't have it, then you only get two boosts.

49:32 Gary:  But they could be any two free ones.

49:34 Gary:  So we'll play it with the default for everybody.

49:37 Gary:  Their ancestry dictates two bonuses for you and you generally get one free one.

49:41 Gary:  Some, some don't get a free.

49:42 Gary:  But I think it's pretty much from what I saw.

49:44 Gary:  Everybody gets to given and then one free.

49:50 Gary:  Let me know when everybody's past that.

49:52 Gary:  So we have everybody has their ancestry set up.

50:00 Braedon:  Awesome.

50:01 Gary:  We got quite, quite, quite the party.

50:03 Gary:  I'd expect nothing less from, from this group, to be honest.

50:07 Braedon:  So you said we're all taking the default boost?

50:11 Gary:  Yeah, yeah. So take default. So default basically dictates two of the attributes based on your ancestry and then you

50:18 Gary:  get one free one to select.

50:19 Gary:  You won't be able. The background little button will be grayed out until you select everything in the ancestry.

50:25 Gary:  So you can see like you only have one of the 01,01.

50:29 Gary:  You gotta select all of those.

50:33 Vic:  A lot of options, man.

50:36 Gary:  That, that's one of the. The good and bad that this system has.

50:40 Gary:  Right There's. That's where people said It's a little overwhelming because there is a lot of options after you.

50:48 Gary:  I think after. I would think after you get level one, basically they spoon feed it afterward.

50:53 Gary:  But one of the nice things is every single level you get a new option.

50:56 Gary:  So like when you go to level two, you'll get a class option.

50:58 Gary:  Level three, you get an ancestry option.

51:00 Gary:  Through every level you're getting something new, which is kind of fun and shaping your character.

51:05 Gary:  And out of those, there is quite a few options to choose from though.

51:08 Gary:  But. Yeah.

51:11 Braedon:  So my default button on mine doesn't do anything because it says free.

51:17 Gary:  You don't have to select it.

51:18 Gary:  It's already selected. It should be blue.

51:20 Gary:  So if you scroll down, you should see acquired and the ones that are already dictated to you and the

51:26 Gary:  ones that say select, you should be able to select one of those options.

51:29 Gary:  And once you do that, you.

51:31 Gary:  You've completed the task for that.

51:33 Chris:  Okay.

51:34 Braedon:  None of them required. All of them say select.

51:37 Gary:  Okay. So you might have. Is your.

51:42 Gary:  Yeah. Okay, so maybe Orc has two free ones or something, you know.

51:50 Braedon:  Oh, that's harder. No, multiple.

51:52 Gary:  Yeah, or you get two free ones.

51:54 Gary:  Yeah. So you can pick any two you want.

51:57 Oded Welgreen:  Sorry, I'm. I'm now at the boost phase and I.

52:02 Oded Welgreen:  I should click default. Default.

52:05 Gary:  Default's already selected. It's blue.

52:06 Oded Welgreen:  Okay.

52:07 Gary:  Now you just scroll down and you'll see those attributes.

52:10 Gary:  Strength, intelligence, dexterity. Some will be acquired because of your ancestry.

52:15 Gary:  You'll be able to select one of the ones that say select and that's your free choice.

52:19 Oded Welgreen:  And I get one?

52:21 Gary:  You get one, yeah.

52:22 Chris:  Oh, I see. Okay.

52:24 Gary:  And then that should complete that step.

52:26 Gary:  And then the background, I think at that point should be selected so you can move on to selecting background.

52:35 Gary:  Is everybody there? Yep. Cool. Backgrounds will be super annoying if you thought you had a lot of options before.

52:45 Gary:  The background list is ginormous because every single background from every single book that they had for, like since the

52:53 Gary:  creation of Pathfinder 2 is in that list.

52:56 Gary:  We don't have all of them available.

52:59 Gary:  So you'll have to find the ones that you kind of like.

53:01 Gary:  I would say searching around might be the easiest.

53:04 Gary:  What a background is supposed to be is essentially like what you did kind of in your early history, so

53:11 Gary:  before you kind of became an adventurer or something like that, or as part of your upbringing.

53:16 Gary:  So it could be, hey, you're a noble or you're a charlatan, kind of like the backgrounds in D D,

53:21 Gary:  they can be fairly specific, like you're an acupuncturist.

53:24 Gary:  Or you are a gossiper. They have a lot of different backgrounds so that this will be a difficult list

53:33 Gary:  to scrap. Screen. All they have is a, I think a top filter button where you can start typing things

53:38 Gary:  to filter out the list if you know what you're looking for.

53:41 Gary:  But like the continual scroll in that sucker gets really long.

53:46 Gary:  Like I said, every single background that's possible in the game is in there.

53:50 Gary:  That's another thing I wish there's a.

53:53 Gary:  There's a settings on my side where I can set up the campaign and I can tell it like which

53:57 Gary:  sources to use. But it's. It doesn't filter them out.

54:01 Gary:  It just. It. I wish it did because it would make this much faster.

54:04 Gary:  But like I said, my guess is they want you to like, oh, I really want to be so and

54:09 Gary:  so. I want to be a ninja.

54:10 Gary:  And there's no Ninja, but for 40 bucks I could be a ninja.

54:13 Gary:  Okay. Like that. So. But yeah.

54:18 Gary:  So backgrounds, like I said, is if you have an idea of your character or like where what motivated them,

54:24 Gary:  that might be the best way to find a background.

54:26 Gary:  And background usually gives you a couple of feet or something or maybe a boost option as well, depending on

54:32 Gary:  the background that you select. And it's really there to kind of like say it gives you a few extra

54:37 Gary:  bonuses, but also kind of supposed to shape your background a bit.

55:14 Braedon:  I think I might have a lot of.

55:16 Gary:  There's a lot of backgrounds.

55:20 Braedon:  Like bounty.

55:20 Gary:  Hunters, you know, is in there.

55:23 Gary:  Butcher. You see, I'm only in the bees.

55:32 Vic:  I may go Bandit. I. I don't want to have like a recency bias or whatever.

55:38 Vic:  Right. Like I get into the list.

55:39 Vic:  I don't want to just jump at a B.

55:40 Vic:  I gotta just get to partway through the Alphabet here, man.

55:46 Vic:  Yeah, but it seems with the, like, Bandit was good with the rogue, you.

55:50 Gary:  Know,

55:56 Gary:  And I don't know how they do this.

55:57 Gary:  Peter. Sorry, go ahead.

56:01 Chris:  Oh, no, just the farm hand is tempting.

56:03 Chris:  I mean, I'm just looking at the attributes, but farm hand fits with the old West.

56:07 Chris:  Stranger, farmhand.

56:11 Gary:  It takes notes. But we'll have to figure out like, why.

56:13 Gary:  Why you. Why did you leave? Is it a dark past? Why you left? Is it.

56:18 Chris:  It's not too dark.

56:19 Braedon:  No. Okay.

56:20 Chris:  Yeah. I think. I think he's older.

56:23 Chris:  His children are grown.

56:25 Gary:  Okay.

56:25 Chris:  He's out in the world, you know.

56:27 Gary:  Right. Empty nester. Okay. His spouse passed away.

56:32 Chris:  Oh yeah. Maybe, Maybe. Yeah. So children grow.

56:34 David:  He just told him to get a hobby.

56:38 Chris:  Oh, he'll find a hobby.

56:42 Oded Welgreen:  Okay. So after I choose background, I need to.

56:46 Oded Welgreen:  What's. Like specify lore.

56:51 Gary:  So if. Yeah, if your background has a lore where you have to specify generally that's a free text field,

56:57 Gary:  I think. Yeah, you can type in what you want.

57:00 Gary:  So you get to pick something that you had some type of, you know, and it could be like specific

57:08 Gary:  to Little shore. If you want K sha 2 yi or whatever onis.

57:13 Gary:  It could be conspiracies. It could be arcana.

57:18 Gary:  Like what religion? Like, maybe they're heraldry.

57:23 Gary:  Maybe you're. You're up on that.

57:24 Gary:  Like what. What do you think your character would have studied that he is like a subject matter experiment for

57:28 Gary:  him.

57:30 Oded Welgreen:  And I can like, I, I can make it up.

57:32 Oded Welgreen:  I can choose whatever I want.

57:34 Gary:  Yep. Yeah. I can give you a bunch of suggestions that I, I kind of pieced together the other night

57:38 Gary:  thinking, like, hey, lore is going to be a difficult skill and so maybe there's some options.

57:43 Gary:  So like I put together even just local.

57:46 Gary:  Like you say local or regional, like willow shore.

57:48 Gary:  Like you just know the area.

57:50 Gary:  Kind of like what David's character is picking.

57:52 Gary:  You can go a little bit bigger, like trip Ye Lore.

57:55 Gary:  Like so you know, like you know what happened in the nation.

57:58 Gary:  So you kind of study that.

58:01 Gary:  You can go with Oni Lord.

58:02 Gary:  So you're someone who's really interested in the, in the demons, in their, their culture or politics or whatever it

58:07 Gary:  might be. You can. I said theater lore.

58:13 Gary:  Like maybe you like drama. So you, you.

58:15 Gary:  There's like classical plays or something like that that you're in.

58:18 Gary:  You kind of specialized in or are interested in.

58:23 Chris:  Spirits.

58:23 Gary:  So spirits are definitely everywhere. Right.

58:25 Gary:  So people, this world has spirits that are like the river spirits and other things will be part of this.

58:31 Gary:  So maybe that's something you're interested in or really focused on the forest itself.

58:35 Gary:  So the dark forest. So maybe you're.

58:37 Gary:  You're thinking like that. So yeah, almost anything is possible here.

58:41 Gary:  I'm.

58:41 Oded Welgreen:  I'm thinking of. So tell me if this makes sense.

58:44 Oded Welgreen:  So my. I want my character to be.

58:48 Oded Welgreen:  He's a scout. He was sent by the Leshy people or some village of the Leshy people to gather intelligence

58:55 Oded Welgreen:  about the oni because they know they're coming.

58:59 Oded Welgreen:  And he's connected to the other Leshy through the mycelium.

59:03 Oded Welgreen:  So maybe something like geology. Does that make sense?

59:07 Gary:  Sure.

59:11 Chris:  Vicky asked about healing, so I'm leaning away from champion.

59:15 Chris:  I'm making a dwarf fighter, but I can pick a field medic background, which gives me a battle medicine skill

59:21 Chris:  feet.

59:21 Vic:  I have the option of a corpse stitcher, that would help a healer, so I just thought that would call

59:25 Vic:  that out.

59:27 Oded Welgreen:  Chris. I. I picked a Claire, so.

59:31 Chris:  Okay. I mean, I don't know.

59:34 Chris:  And Gary, maybe you can weigh in or something.

59:36 Chris:  I mean, do you think that would be helpful? Something we still need in terms of, like, a fighter with

59:41 Chris:  the battle medicine, field medic background.

59:45 Gary:  I mean, like I said before, the.

59:48 Gary:  If, you know, OED's character, whatever his name is going to be, is not around.

59:53 Gary:  Healing is pretty limited. There's obviously potions and.

59:59 Gary:  But the natural way of healing, if you're not trained in medicine is, like, impossible.

60:05 Gary:  The only thing I think that they can.

60:07 Gary:  That you can do untrained is to try to.

60:09 Gary:  Basically the idea is like, you can slap someone away from trying to die, so you can, you know, prevent

60:14 Gary:  someone from dying, but you can't heal wounds and 10 wounds or poisons or diseases.

60:20 Gary:  When you're trained, you can do those types of things.

60:22 Gary:  So Odette's character can be great.

60:24 Gary:  He's got magical abilities to, like, cure those things.

60:28 Gary:  But it might be good to have, you know, a secondary thing to help.

60:33 Chris:  Yeah, field medic, battle medicine.

60:35 Gary:  Got it.

60:41 David:  So I also wizard, but I also took the field medic background, so I have a little bit of healing.

60:48 Gary:  Okay, so you did, too.

60:52 Gary:  Did you guys train in the same school?

60:55 Braedon:  Oh, maybe that'd be cool. Or maybe we.

60:59 David:  Did you go to you Willow Shore?

61:03 Chris:  I was thinking more like I was in.

61:04 Chris:  I was in some sort of dwarven, I don't know, skirmishes or something, and I was trained, like, you know,

61:11 Chris:  just sort of in the battlefield or something.

61:15 Gary:  Right now we have a legend of character who.

61:18 Gary:  We have no idea how old he is.

61:20 Gary:  Maybe. Maybe he's super old. Way older than.

61:25 Gary:  Than the typical human would be.

61:28 Gary:  And maybe he went by a different name.

61:32 Gary:  But you swear his voice might sound familiar from when you were fighting, you know, eons ago, younger, before, you

61:40 Gary:  know, whatever war tribe or something that you had to.

61:45 Gary:  Had to join whatever campaign that was.

61:51 David:  What are you talking about? I'm just an old timer with backstory.

61:55 Gary:  Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course you are.

62:00 Gary:  So, yeah. So background, hopefully. I think it sounds like most of you guys got through that point where you

62:04 Gary:  select the background just like you do with the other steps.

62:06 Gary:  And it gives you a couple options depending on the background.

62:09 Gary:  Some of them have one or two options generally.

62:12 Gary:  Sometimes it's an ability boost, sometimes it's.

62:13 Gary:  It's a fixed, you know, a bonus.

62:17 Gary:  And again, if anybody has a Lore skill we can talk through some different ones there, but that's a very

62:21 Gary:  flexible skill. So what I'll try to do, you guys, like I said, I mentioned this before, some of the

62:28 Gary:  folks played with me before, but I'm definitely a yes and.

62:31 Gary:  Or yes, but. And if you guys pick stuff and we talk through this, like, building relationship between your characters

62:37 Gary:  or in the scene or, like, I'll try to figure out ways of making that part of it because, you

62:42 Gary:  know, it bites to pick something and, like, it's useless.

62:47 Gary:  So somehow, if we have. Somehow geology will play an important role somewhere along the line.

62:54 Gary:  So. So that Odette's character can shine the spotlight on him.

62:59 Oded Welgreen:  Nice. I changed it to ecology, but same idea.

63:02 Gary:  Okay, that's a good one. That's even.

63:03 Gary:  That's probably better. Yeah, that's a good one.

63:08 Gary:  So after background is finally class.

63:12 Gary:  Here's where you select your class.

63:15 Gary:  And

63:19 Gary:  there's not as many classes, but there's still quite a few.

63:21 Gary:  So you have the available ones.

63:24 Gary:  I think it sounds like most everybody had kind of selected, and each class has a few options to it.

63:32 Gary:  The classes who are. Let's see, we have.

63:37 Gary:  We have one cleric. We don't have any druid.

63:41 Gary:  I don't know, actually, Braden, I think.

63:44 Gary:  Are you going to stay with investigator?

63:46 Braedon:  Yeah, I do have to put four, which I'm struggling with.

63:52 Gary:  Okay, we can talk through that one a bit.

63:57 Gary:  The investigator in this world is.

64:00 Gary:  I don't know if you saw the options, but one is kind of a Dexter like option.

64:04 Gary:  If you read ahead of it.

64:06 Gary:  But they analyze, like, empirical knowledge, like blood splatters and stuff like that.

64:13 Gary:  You can do that kind of thing.

64:14 Gary:  Other. Another one is, like, very observational, like Sherlock Holmes style.

64:19 Gary:  So that was kind of interesting, too.

64:22 Gary:  So the. The folks who have, like, cleric who have spells, they have a longer option because you're gonna have

64:29 Gary:  to, you know, select your spells after.

64:31 Gary:  After the main section. But otherwise it works like backgrounds and stuff.

64:36 Gary:  It'll have, like, a tree of options.

64:37 Gary:  You have to select. You get through all those, then you finally move to equipment.

64:43 Gary:  So, Brady, you had lore. Is what you're.

64:48 Braedon:  Doing replacement training.

64:52 Gary:  You want lore of, like, a place, an area of security thing? Like, what.

64:58 Gary:  What. Why. Why is your guy an investigator? Against it?

65:01 Braedon:  So he has the detective background.

65:03 Gary:  Okay.

65:04 Braedon:  Because I used to. In the.

65:06 Braedon:  In the orc caverns, I was.

65:09 Braedon:  I was the detective that kept the people in line.

65:13 Braedon:  So I already have orc lore and underworld lore.

65:18 Gary:  Okay.

65:19 Braedon:  But I get a society replacement training, and I'm leaning towards Diplomacy.

65:26 Braedon:  I'm gonna be the weirdest orc, you guys.

65:31 Gary:  All right, so, yeah. So diplomacy as.

65:38 Gary:  How about. Should we. Do you want to.

65:40 Gary:  Like, there's kind of two factions of, like, diplomacy.

65:44 Gary:  Diplomacy might be a little bit too broad.

65:46 Gary:  You can do, like, empirical diplomas, see, which is, like, the emperor.

65:52 Gary:  And, like, how the clans and factions in Jianxia, which is, like, a feudal Japan style, if you.

66:01 Gary:  It's a fantasy setting, but it definitely borrows from, like, how there were clans in feudal Japan, Japan in, like,

66:07 Gary:  the 1400s or whatever it was, period.

66:11 Gary:  So you could have, like, diplomacy there, which in this world would be more on how not to.

66:19 Gary:  Maybe we'll just leave it at diplomacy if you like that one, because we can work that into, like, you

66:23 Gary:  understand, Kind of like, you're not supposed to look at the oni walking into a town.

66:32 Gary:  The tea ceremony should be performed this way for appeasement.

66:37 Gary:  There's certain, you know, rules, stricture, and things like that that need to be followed, and you understand those.

66:46 Gary:  So, you know, you could do that if you want.

66:48 Braedon:  I like that because I'm thinking of a backstory of, like, I'm suspicious about the oni appearing suddenly after so

66:55 Braedon:  long. So I would be kind of wealthy in this society.

67:00 Gary:  Okay, cool.

67:01 Braedon:  Plus, I used to study history of China in high school in Singapore, so I think I could work that

67:06 Braedon:  in.

67:07 Gary:  Okay.

67:13 Gary:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

67:16 Vic:  I've narrowed it down to 10 up.

67:17 Vic:  I feel good about that.

67:19 Gary:  All right. For. For your rogue options.

67:23 Vic:  My background. I'm still going through background.

67:26 Gary:  So many choices. There's a lot of.

67:29 Braedon:  It gets worse. I have to pick seven investigator skill trainings.

67:36 Gary:  You'Re gonna do. Like, it's kind of like the rogue, where embargoes a little bit like this, but definitely the

67:43 Gary:  rogue in D and D, where you'll be able to do almost be trained in almost every single skill that's

67:48 Gary:  there. And when you select skills, lore is a skill that is a little button at the top of the

67:56 Gary:  skills list. So out of those seven that you.

67:59 Gary:  That you have, you know, like, you'll see stuff like stealth, right? Acrobatics, athletics, climbing, things like survival.

68:08 Gary:  Those are skills there in that list, and you can be trained in those.

68:11 Gary:  But if you want additional lore, then there's a lore button at top because you.

68:18 Gary:  Lore is, again, like, a very flexible skill that can be anything.

68:20 Gary:  So you can add more lore if you wanted to.

68:29 Braedon:  This might take me a minute.

68:32 Gary:  That's right. I thought this would take us the longest amount of time, but this would be.

68:36 Gary:  This would be fun. And then after this we don't have as much actually very little after that.

68:44 Oded Welgreen:  Does the deity do anything other than just like backstory?

68:49 Gary:  Oh yeah, you're the cleric, right? I did.

68:57 Gary:  Here's the list of available deities.

68:59 Gary:  If you did the list, I don't know if you saw that.

69:01 Gary:  There's like a bazillion of those as well.

69:02 Braedon:  Yeah.

69:03 Oded Welgreen:  Yep.

69:05 Gary:  Here's the list that are cheap.

69:18 Gary:  Here's the list of deities that Tian Shaw that are valid in Tian Sha.

69:25 Gary:  Still not a small list. The like five at the bottom are more global.

69:30 Gary:  The ones at the top are very thematic to T and Sha.

69:36 Gary:  The what your deity gives you is quite a few things.

69:40 Gary:  It generally gives you a skill that's kind of like the.

69:45 Gary:  The deity's favorite skill, I guess.

69:48 Gary:  It gives you generally a favored weapon.

69:51 Gary:  So you're going to be always proficient in your deities weapon.

69:55 Gary:  It'll give you what they call a font.

69:58 Gary:  F O N T. I think that's what they call it.

70:00 Gary:  It'll be either harm or heal.

70:04 Gary:  And if you want to be a healer, make sure you take heal.

70:08 Gary:  Some deities allow you to choose.

70:10 Gary:  Others are only harm and some are only heal.

70:15 Gary:  If basically what that gives you is.

70:17 Gary:  Is four free harm spells or four free healing spells that you can cast per day.

70:25 Gary:  So that's what that gives you.

70:28 Gary:  And then the other thing that, that the DT has is a domain.

70:33 Gary:  And the domain will like restrict and limit the types of spells you can cast.

70:38 Gary:  That's usually it. And then they're like, if you read about some of them, you know, they, they have some

70:44 Gary:  anathema is what they call edicts that you do and, and things that you want to avoid.

70:50 Gary:  So that could be important to you as well.

70:53 Oded Welgreen:  So I like, I. I see one that fits.

70:56 Oded Welgreen:  But it's not one of your.

70:57 Oded Welgreen:  Of the list that you posted.

71:00 Gary:  Okay. Who is that? Maybe there's a.

71:02 Oded Welgreen:  It's pharasma.

71:05 Gary:  Ancient phrasal is in there.

71:09 Oded Welgreen:  Oh, oh, okay.

71:11 Gary:  Yeah, it's one of the last ones.

71:12 Gary:  Yep.

71:13 Oded Welgreen:  Oh, great. Okay. That's a good F.

71:18 Gary:  Hey Gary, if.

71:19 Braedon:  I want to add a lore or two.

71:22 Gary:  Yeah.

71:23 Braedon:  Is there a lore for like the spirits and the.

71:29 Braedon:  Okay, what would that one be?

71:32 Gary:  Spirit lore. Cool.

71:35 Braedon:  I probably should have guessed that.

71:38 Gary:  We could make them up.

71:39 Oded Welgreen:  So.

71:40 Gary:  So yeah, we can. Yeah.

71:42 Braedon:  And then I think I'll also do that Imperial lore, like you said.

71:45 Braedon:  That's a good idea.

71:53 Gary:  All right. You got down to five backgrounds.

71:58 Braedon:  Three.

71:59 Vic:  Three, three.

72:00 Gary:  Not bad.

72:01 Braedon:  Company.

72:01 Vic:  Agent Eager, Scofflaw or Trade representative.

72:08 Braedon:  Immediate.

72:09 Vic:  And also.

72:11 Braedon:  What I mean immediately. Eager scofflaw.

72:14 Braedon:  That's gonna be so much fucking fun.

72:16 Vic:  Yeah, so in that one I was thinking that I was a member of the Disposed family.

72:20 Vic:  And when we got disposed, for the last 20 years I've had to become a rogue, living about town and

72:25 Vic:  stealing and making my way on my own.

72:28 Vic:  And I'm joining your all's party to do whatever it is we're gonna do to the oni or to the

72:32 Vic:  family or whatever we're gonna do there.

72:33 Vic:  I'll work that out later.

72:36 Braedon:  And maybe that's our background connection.

72:38 Braedon:  Not to jump ahead, Gary, but if I'm.

72:40 Braedon:  If I'm suspicious of the new oni and I'm investigating a little bit maybe.

72:44 Braedon:  I uncovered that Vic is a member of the former royal family and I searched him.

72:51 Gary:  Does that mean that is the royal family all halflings or is he some type of like.

72:58 Vic:  I could have married into it.

73:00 Vic:  I'm quite attractive according to this description.

73:02 Vic:  I could have married into.

73:04 Gary:  All right?

73:06 Braedon:  I think it's better if they're not all halflings.

73:08 Braedon:  If they're like some weird assortment.

73:10 Gary:  All right?

73:12 Braedon:  Like every family is. You should see me amongst all my in laws.

73:18 Braedon:  They're all like this tall.

73:20 Vic:  So the funniest part about the eager scofflaw, it comes with the bon mot skill feet where you get to

73:30 Vic:  make a quip at somebody and it kind of like makes you have the.

73:35 Vic:  Makes them lose focus and you get to attack first and stuff by making smart ass comments and whatnot.

73:40 Vic:  So.

73:42 Braedon:  So when I played my bard, my sylvan bard in a previous campaign, DND has a couple spells like that

73:52 Braedon:  and it is so much fun.

73:56 Braedon:  I really missed that character because he was a blast.

74:02 Gary:  There you are. There you go.

74:06 Vic:  Like that's fun, right? I'm going with eager scofflaw and I'm doing it.

74:11 Gary:  Thanks.

74:16 Gary:  Hope you're good at diplomacy checks.

74:26 Braedon:  Remember when I took the college of eloquence and then every.

74:29 Braedon:  You'd have to make. What was it like a speech check.

74:32 Braedon:  I had like a minimum of 18.

74:34 Gary:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was. That was crazy.

74:39 Oded Welgreen:  I.

74:39 Braedon:  With Gary so hard, I basically couldn't fail the role.

74:44 Gary:  It was great almost. Yeah. That made the failures that much more amazing then.

74:52 Braedon:  Oh yeah.

74:53 Gary:  Only they ever happened. But that would have made him amazing.

74:57 Braedon:  Well, because if I failed, I got a re roll only.

75:01 Gary:  That's right.

75:02 Braedon:  God, that character was so overpowered.

75:06 Gary:  Except in combat.

75:10 Braedon:  He's fucking useless in a fight.

75:21 Gary:  I think. Let's see, did your.

75:25 Gary:  What did you pick. Did you sign to do wizard or cleric or bar? Like David Wizard.

75:31 Gary:  Yeah. Okay, where are you? Because wizard has some obviously spell book.

75:40 Gary:  I don't know if you're that far along yet.

75:42 David:  Yeah, I'm looking at spells now.

75:47 Gary:  So. Yeah, you should have a list of like cantrips, like four or eight.

75:51 Gary:  I don't remember. They have a decent number.

75:53 Gary:  And then I think spells.

75:57 Chris:  Yeah.

75:57 David:  And let's see, five spells.

76:01 Gary:  Okay, well, maybe because you have plus one intelligence up maybe.

76:04 Gary:  Okay.

76:13 David:  Oh, plus four.

76:17 Gary:  Chris, where. Where are you? You're.

76:18 Gary:  Are you still champion? Oh, you're a fighter.

76:21 Chris:  Oh, fighter. Yeah. I'm picking skills and I have a much more straightforward choice thing going on than a lot

76:28 Chris:  of you. But it's still, you know, it's still fun.

76:29 Chris:  So. Yes, he's got athletics plus seven, intimidation plus three.

76:36 Chris:  Can pick a couple more. I'm thinking like, you know,

76:43 Chris:  survival or nature would make sense.

76:45 Chris:  I don't know how often those come up.

76:47 Chris:  I could also just bump medicine.

76:49 Chris:  Medicine's already trained. Never mind. Plus five.

76:51 Chris:  Medicine.

76:56 Gary:  Surv. Survival is a good one of the wilderness that those.

77:00 Gary:  Those checks come at come about a decent amount as you guys are venturing out to like, you know, wilderness

77:08 Gary:  areas. Forest is around us, so there's a good chance there.

77:12 Chris:  Yeah, that would make sense. So I've done survival.

77:14 Chris:  I think I've got one more epic, which might be.

77:18 Gary:  Yeah, the other thing, I guess I didn't mention, I mentioned that.

77:20 Gary:  And you can see it there you go from like untrained to train, you know, experts, whatever that gives you

77:25 Gary:  more bonus, you know, pluses. But expert, you have to be third level before you can like be an expert

77:31 Gary:  in any skill. Like fifth level or seventh level is like mastery or something like that.

77:36 Gary:  So. So there are feats that allow you to like do that a little bit earlier.

77:41 Gary:  But it's kind of like a gatekeeping kind of thing.

77:44 Gary:  So like someone who's a mastery at a certain level, it's probably got a decent amount experience in it.

77:51 Gary:  So they. They kind of like for.

77:52 Gary:  That's why you can't. If you notice that you couldn't select that skill again to go up one even if

77:56 Gary:  you had, you know, available picks.

77:59 Gary:  It won't let you because you're on first level.

78:03 David:  Gary, do you know what warfare lore is? I have it, but I don't know why.

78:09 Gary:  You must have got it from a background or maybe you got it because of what.

78:15 David:  Oh, I did take deal FedEx.

78:18 Gary:  Yeah, so. So you. You've studied, you know, War.

78:24 Gary:  Whether it's, you know, battles in history that happen that you can recite strategy of warfare.

78:32 Gary:  And this would be more like mass combat kind of warfare.

78:34 Braedon:  Right.

78:35 Gary:  Where you're like a commander or, you know, doing, you know, a general type of thing.

78:41 Gary:  So that would be. The sieges might be a part of that too.

78:48 Oded Welgreen:  What does. I'm choosing medicine replacement training.

78:58 Oded Welgreen:  And I have an Ad Lore button.

79:00 Oded Welgreen:  What does that mean?

79:03 Gary:  So the Ad Lore means you get to have a new lore skill that you want to choose.

79:12 Gary:  So it's another, like, research area.

79:17 Oded Welgreen:  Okay.

79:18 Gary:  Oh, so you said replace medicine.

79:21 Gary:  That happens a lot of times when you can't up that skill level because medicine's max.

79:27 Gary:  So they give you a alternative.

79:31 Oded Welgreen:  I see.

79:35 Oded Welgreen:  So I can't go more than trained at this stage.

79:40 Gary:  Yep, yep.

79:44 Vic:  I clicked like eight times and it didn't work dead.

79:46 Vic:  So, yeah, I guess it doesn't let you do it.

79:50 Gary:  I tried repeated anyway.

79:53 Braedon:  It was very confusing.

79:56 Gary:  Yeah, so that. Yeah, that's kind of.

79:57 Gary:  Kind of weird at first, but so they.

80:00 Gary:  They have that. It'll unlock the next levels, you know, as you level up.

80:04 Gary:  So I think, you know, as you get, you'll be able to get, you know, mastery in only a few

80:09 Gary:  skills because you can't, you know, get that until like seventh level or ninth level or maybe it's legendary.

80:20 Gary:  The other thing that you'll notice in this game is the pluses get much bigger than they did in D

80:25 Gary:  and D. D had a very bounded kind of system where it had like, hey, most things are like, within,

80:32 Gary:  like, you know, plus eight. So minus eight would be like the big range.

80:36 Gary:  Anything beyond that is, like, kind of crazy.

80:38 Gary:  This is unbounded. And that's the other reason why when you roll a die, the number could be pretty big.

80:46 Gary:  A roll of 20 does not critically hit in Pathfinder.

80:51 Gary:  Rolling 10 over your target number does.

80:54 Gary:  So if you're really, really good at something where you're adding like 10 to 15, 20 to that role and

81:00 Gary:  you're fighting someone who is pathetic, you might be critically hitting them every single time you attack them, because you're

81:06 Gary:  just that good. So it doesn't have.

81:10 Gary:  And the same thing with failure.

81:12 Gary:  The one doesn't mean automatic failure.

81:13 Gary:  10 below is. Is what they do there.

81:16 Gary:  So there's some. It's a sliding scale, so it's unbounded that way.

81:20 Gary:  So if you're like someone who's a master swordsman and you're adding plus 15 to your rolls, you roll a

81:27 Gary:  D20 and you happen to roll a 20, you know, that's 35.

81:30 Gary:  Your chances of being 10 over your target number might be, you know, pretty high, depending on who you're batting.

81:39 Gary:  And the damage is double. Just like.

81:46 Gary:  The other thing that I think mentioned there is if you look at.

81:49 Gary:  Well, we'll get to the character sheet at the end here.

81:50 Gary:  But you get three actions. Everybody does every single round.

81:55 Gary:  So you can move three times if you want.

81:58 Gary:  You can attack three times if you want, attack twice.

82:01 Gary:  You know, cast a spell. Some actions take only one action.

82:06 Gary:  Some take more than one. So some take all three, depending on the action.

82:09 Gary:  But. But that's basically the action economy.

82:12 Gary:  It's just three. Everybody gets three.

82:19 Gary:  So who. Who else is through the class section? Brayden, maybe? Chris is close.

82:26 Chris:  Close.

82:27 David:  I just finished.

82:28 Oded Welgreen:  Thanks.

82:33 Gary:  So what we'll do, and this may be boring a little bit, but equipment.

82:38 Gary:  There's an option to do like default equipment, your class.

82:41 Gary:  I thought we would just do that if you.

82:45 Gary:  If you want a specific weapon, like let's say you had something in mind for your character to wield a.

82:50 Gary:  A staff instead of the sword that was given.

82:53 Gary:  You know, feel free to take a common weapon to add or.

82:56 Gary:  Or replace. But the package that they give for each class seems is pretty appropriate for each one.

83:03 Gary:  So I thought we would do that.

83:04 Gary:  That gets everything through equipment. Then obviously we'll get new stuff as we play.

83:08 Gary:  But.

83:19 Braedon:  Because I'm a detective background, I think the quick equipment package by default gives me a set like one of

83:29 Braedon:  those weighted.

83:34 Braedon:  I will have a lot of fun with that.

83:41 Braedon:  I used to have. My grandfather was a Louisiana state trooper, so I used to have his baton philly stick.

83:51 Braedon:  I wonder what I did with that.

84:52 Gary:  All right, so we'll do first.

84:56 Gary:  I think Odette and David might take long.

85:00 Gary:  There's a lot of spells to go through and options there.

85:06 Oded Welgreen:  Where do I choose the spells?

85:10 Gary:  It might be. It might be in.

85:14 Gary:  Once we get to the character sheet.

85:16 Gary:  Sheet. I thought it was in the selection process, but maybe it's when you get to the character sheet.

85:22 David:  It was in the little character builder for me.

85:26 Gary:  It was. Yeah. It might be a little different because you might have to pick your.

85:30 Gary:  Your spells that are in your spell book because you're limited.

85:33 Gary:  Oded praise for his spells. His DT gives them.

85:37 Braedon:  So.

85:38 Gary:  So he might just have to select the ones he wants to know on.

85:42 Gary:  On his character sheet. So it's because it's a clar.

85:45 Gary:  Yeah. And I guess we're not leveling up.

85:47 Gary:  You can see like it has all the levels in here, but.

86:00 Gary:  I guess I could have mentioned this too, but you guys.

86:02 Gary:  Ranger. There's a couple things in this game that are also interesting is

86:11 Gary:  animal companions are way more effective than they are in D D for a much longer time.

86:18 Gary:  So if you had the desire of being like a Beastmaster kind of character, it's actually pretty viable in this.

86:24 Gary:  This system than it is in D and D.

86:27 Gary:  Familiars are also a little cooler.

86:30 Gary:  D and D familiars are basically spies for the most part.

86:34 Gary:  They can't do anything else. But in here you get to add feats to your familiar to give them like

86:39 Gary:  unique special abilities. So this would be like David, your character.

86:42 Gary:  If you select a familiar or get one based on your.

86:46 Gary:  Your school or college that you studied, they.

86:50 Gary:  They can be kind of unique and kind of cool.

86:52 Gary:  You can have a more combat focused one.

86:54 Gary:  You can do other things. They can be a.

86:56 Gary:  A shield for you. They can do different things like that.

87:00 Gary:  And they. They advance as you come along so they.

87:03 Gary:  They stay viable. If you want to, you know, keep them that way, you can invest feats into them to

87:07 Gary:  make it even more important. So can the Rangers.

87:10 Gary:  Druid also has that ability. They can also shape change just like the D and D drive

87:17 Gary:  Max.

87:19 David:  I don't think I got one, but I'm definitely gonna go back and look.

87:23 Gary:  There's probably not many options at first, but it builds on it as it goes.

87:26 Gary:  Yeah.

87:28 Vic:  Purchase the quick equipment package, you said.

87:34 Gary:  Yeah, yeah. And then that should take you to the character sheet, which will look overwhelming.

87:39 Braedon:  But.

87:41 Gary:  That'S what we'll. That's what you'll be using in the.

87:43 Gary:  When we actually do the game.

87:50 Gary:  I'll get up to you guys and then we'll talk a little bit about the character sheet 39.

87:57 Gary:  We'll talk a little bit about the character sheet once everybody gets there and then we'll do a couple bonding

88:02 Gary:  things and then talk about when we want to play in Hoff and things like that.

88:07 Gary:  I'll just pick this one.

88:20 David:  It.

88:59 Gary:  So who's. Who made it through equipment? Is that the crazy character sheet?

89:06 Oded Welgreen:  I'm trying to choose a name.

89:07 Oded Welgreen:  Should I wait with that?

89:09 Gary:  What's that?

89:10 Oded Welgreen:  I'm trying to think of a name.

89:12 Oded Welgreen:  I can do that later.

89:15 Gary:  Yeah, you can come back and edit this.

89:17 Gary:  To edit that. There's like that little menu bar after the name.

89:21 Gary:  You can click and it takes you back to the character builder and you can edit anything you want there.

89:25 Gary:  Okay.

89:30 Gary:  Yeah. The character sheet for folks who play D and D beyond is fairly similar.

89:33 Gary:  It's got a similar kind of layout.

89:36 Gary:  But you can export these as well.

89:39 Gary:  So you can export these to PDF if you wanted to.

89:42 Gary:  You can import in other things too, but that's kind of handy.

89:46 Gary:  It's got the dice roller in the bottom left corner like we had before.

89:50 Gary:  This will be linked to roll 20.

89:53 Gary:  So you can actually open your character sheet from inside of roll 20 if you wanted to and actually roll

89:57 Gary:  it that way. And the roll show up in roll 20.

89:59 Gary:  So they have the tighter integration there, which is kind of nice.

90:02 Gary:  You can also do it separately if you want to catch up you multiple screens and separate it out.

90:07 Gary:  But everything's like clickable for rolls anytime.

90:11 Gary:  Like a little die shows up, means you can actually roll that attribute.

90:15 Gary:  I'll wait till the other folks get there and I'll highlight a couple things on the character sheet because they'll

90:19 Gary:  be pretty common stuff that we do.

90:22 Gary:  And then like I said, we'll build a couple of bonds here between characters in the setting.

90:26 Gary:  And then if you guys want to talk about when we want to play and then any other notes that

90:32 Gary:  you guys have.

90:37 Chris:  I accidentally did not purchase equipment, so I'm trying to make my way back there.

90:41 Gary:  Yeah, you should be allowed. That's right.

90:44 Gary:  Yeah. If you go to click the little three bars after the name, whatever your name is, and at the

90:52 Gary:  top there's character builder, you can change the sheet theme to make it more readable.

90:55 Gary:  Kind of like the hand Dr.

90:56 Gary:  1. It's kind of nice. If you go back there, you should be able to jump back to up in

91:04 Gary:  this character builder step and click on equipment.

91:12 Gary:  Oh, this one didn't let me do.

91:15 Vic:  I'll throw a second it on the hand drawn.

91:17 Vic:  Very cool.

91:18 Gary:  Yeah, I like that one.

91:22 Oded Welgreen:  So in the character sheet I can go to spells and like add spells.

91:29 Gary:  Yep.

91:30 Oded Welgreen:  How many spells do I get?

91:32 Gary:  It'll. It'll restrict you. It'll show you how many you get.

91:35 Gary:  So I think you get like four cantrips and.

91:39 Gary:  Or harm or heal spells. They'll be forced in there and you'll see like when you do your spell list,

91:47 Gary:  it'll be a list. Like there'll be.

91:48 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah.

91:48 Gary:  The top section will be cantrips, then your first level spells and then your domain spells or domain fonts I

91:55 Gary:  think they call them. And that'll be listed.

91:58 Gary:  You'll fill in. Like when you click on a spot, a big list of spells will come in.

92:01 Gary:  You'll add that one in there.

92:03 Oded Welgreen:  What's the difference between a ritual and a spell?

92:11 Gary:  Good question. I don't exactly know I know it from D and D, but I don't think that's the same

92:19 Gary:  here.

92:26 Gary:  It might be the same if you take a long time.

92:55 Gary:  Oh, yeah, I remember.

92:59 Gary:  I do remember reading that. So rituals.

93:02 Gary:  Rituals can be cast by anybody.

93:06 Gary:  So anybody can learn how to do a ritual.

93:09 Gary:  It is like a seance. So anybody can.

93:14 Gary:  Can learn those. And they take a long time.

93:17 Gary:  But like, like.

93:22 Vic:  One took eight days that I was looking at.

93:26 Gary:  Yeah.

93:27 Braedon:  So but once it's done.

93:31 Gary:  Yeah, it's resurrect or something, maybe.

93:35 Gary:  I think resurrect is a ritual, so I don't think it's a spell.

93:40 Gary:  So if you want to bring someone back from the dead, you gotta get a bunch of people and do

93:45 Gary:  whatever the ritual says to.

93:59 Gary:  Chris. Were you able to get your equipment?

94:02 Chris:  I did. I hadn't clicked purchase actually, so I did that and then I'm back at the character sheet where

94:08 Chris:  I should be.

94:09 David:  Yeah.

94:10 Gary:  And you should see. So if you're at the character sheet, you'll see kind of ways laid out.

94:14 Gary:  Right. Your name is at the top, attributes are across the top.

94:18 Gary:  And then your arm class saving throws, hit points.

94:20 Gary:  Those hopefully are still familiar. Everybody who played D and D, they're the exact same terms and they do the

94:25 Gary:  exact same thing. The numbers might be different.

94:27 Gary:  Armor class will be higher than normal.

94:29 Gary:  Like you'll say, wow, I have a 17 armor class.

94:31 Gary:  I'm wearing leather armor. That's a lot higher than dd, but that's the normal here.

94:37 Gary:  Hit points you'll see is a little bit higher as well.

94:40 Gary:  Then there's like a section for your movements and things like that.

94:43 Gary:  And if you have any conditions, like you're blinded, that you can add that to the character sheet.

94:48 Gary:  And that way anything you click on all those modifiers will be applied, which is pretty handy.

94:55 Gary:  Initiative is in the middle there.

94:57 Gary:  And then if you look, there's a primary offhand.

95:00 Gary:  So anybody can wield two weapons if you want.

95:04 Gary:  You're just better at it. Some.

95:05 Gary:  Some people are better at than others, but you'll see three boxes there.

95:10 Gary:  And so the way that this works is you get three actions.

95:15 Gary:  Let's say I'm standing in front of somebody and I.

95:18 Gary:  I swing my sword at them.

95:19 Gary:  You click the first box, which is generally your best pluses.

95:23 Gary:  So the first attack is the easiest.

95:25 Gary:  You just attack a second time, it's a little harder, usually like minus 5.

95:30 Gary:  This third attack is minus 10.

95:32 Gary:  So your chances of hitting the third attack in a row is a lot less.

95:36 Gary:  That's where fighters and other Martial characters have ways of offsetting those minuses, so they're more likely to hit multiple

95:45 Gary:  attacks than other classes. But if you're a wizard with a sword, you can swing it three times if you

95:51 Gary:  want. You just might not be as effective as the fighter doing it.

95:57 Gary:  But that's what. That's why those three boxes are there.

95:59 Gary:  So the first attack in your route is the.

96:02 Gary:  The best one. If you attack twice, you'll click the second button, second little box, and then you'll pick the

96:08 Gary:  third one for the 32nd round if you do take it.

96:14 Gary:  And then below that, you'll have kind of a tab layout of, like, your skills and feats, your equipment.

96:21 Gary:  That's where, like, if you get a new piece of equipment or sell things, you'll do that.

96:25 Gary:  If you have spells, it'll be listed there.

96:27 Gary:  All of your feats and features are listed in that.

96:29 Gary:  And then you can do your own notes and details for, like, your languages, your character notes and background, if

96:37 Gary:  you want to do it there.

96:39 Vic:  Why do I have so many spells available to select?

96:44 Gary:  You'll see. You should see the spell list, but you won't be able to cast anything, so you shouldn't.

96:48 Gary:  Like, if you click spells, the only thing that you could add would be a ritual.

96:53 Gary:  So no one should add rituals to themselves, at least today.

96:59 Gary:  Maybe a spellcaster could, if it makes sense, but none of the non spellcasters would have a ritual because rituals

97:05 Gary:  can be cast by anybody but you.

97:09 Gary:  Does it let you do that? It does look like it lets you do it, huh? Yeah, I was looking

97:13 Gary:  at it.

97:13 Vic:  I got. I wasn't thinking that I had any of those capabilities to do anything with them.

97:19 Vic:  I did add a ritual fortifying brew.

97:21 Vic:  That sounded fun. I was going to brew us up some fortifying drinks, but I stopped it because Gary didn't

97:27 Vic:  want us to have any funds, so.

97:28 Gary:  Yeah, not yet. More fun later.

97:32 David:  You got to build character.

97:34 Gary:  It looks like you can add any spell you want.

97:36 Gary:  But I can't cast it. It doesn't actually do anything.

97:39 Gary:  Yeah, I guess I can cast the damage it does, but I can't cast the spell because I don't have

97:45 Gary:  any spell available. But that is kind of a miss.

97:48 Gary:  I wish they would that.

97:50 Braedon:  Yeah, like, I can add spell.

97:53 Braedon:  I don't think think I have any magic.

97:55 Gary:  Yeah, you would. Yeah. The usually, like, class will have a spell trait, right? Which is like, you know, wisdom

98:04 Gary:  for a druid, intelligence for a wizard.

98:06 Gary:  And so if you don't have a spell trait, you should be able to cast spells.

98:11 Gary:  Or even add them. Only rituals.

98:13 Gary:  But definitely looks like the character sheet lets you do whatever there.

98:18 David:  Yeah, mine has. It has the spell slots for, like, wizard spells, ca casting, and in my spell schools.

98:24 David:  Then underneath that, it has the rituals and additional spells.

98:27 David:  So I assume any character can add a custom spell if you want.

98:31 Gary:  Yeah. Yeah. And it looks like it's available for everybody, but.

98:35 Gary:  Yeah. So you don't need to fill that in unless you got a spellcaster, which maybe you have just two.

98:44 Braedon:  So, Chris and Vic. You guys know that you have to have a voice to your character, right? You can't

98:49 Braedon:  speak in your regular voice.

98:54 Chris:  We have a very thick.

98:59 Vic:  I've been working on a Jimmy I version of your voice, Braden.

99:05 Braedon:  Why do you think I picked the orc? It's.

99:07 Braedon:  It's natural. I just go lower.

99:09 Gary:  Totally valid. Yeah. If you reference anybody by their real life name, you have to put a dollar in the

99:15 Gary:  jar, which goes to the. At the end of the campaign.

99:19 Gary:  That's good. That would be a cool rule, though.

99:22 Braedon:  That would be fun. My team started doing a swear jar for me.

99:27 Gary:  Huh.

99:28 Braedon:  Said every time I swear.

99:31 Oded Welgreen:  Why would they do that? Braden.

99:36 Braedon:  Before I took over, never swore.

99:40 Braedon:  And apparently I'm a bad influence.

99:43 Braedon:  Stop.

99:43 Gary:  Where I think is what they're saying.

99:50 Gary:  Everybody get to the character sheet.

99:52 Gary:  It looks like everybody. I think our spell casters are collecting our spells.

99:55 Gary:  Cool. So, yeah, the sheet may look pretty complicated.

99:58 Gary:  Like I said, we'll keep using it, obviously, as we go along.

100:03 Gary:  And at any time, you guys can go to Demiplane and click around and see what happens.

100:08 Gary:  But that's basically the special. When you do damage, you'll see the hit points you can enter in.

100:15 Gary:  That is either healing damage or not.

100:17 Gary:  And your current hit points are.

100:20 Gary:  If I ask for, like a saving throw, you can see like, hey, what's your reflex? You know, saving throw.

100:24 Gary:  You can hover over reflex. Like in this character I created had +5, you click on it, it rolls it

100:30 Gary:  for you in the corner. So.

100:33 Gary:  So that's. That's kind of how we'll do die rolls and everything.

100:35 Gary:  If you want, you can die roll manually.

100:38 Gary:  I know there's been consternation over some of these random dice rollers that exist in some of these sheets.

100:46 Gary:  So maybe you want to actually physically roll it.

100:49 Gary:  That's fine. I don't. I don't mind it either.

100:51 Gary:  You know what the pluses are, and you can do the math.

100:55 Braedon:  Cool.

100:55 Gary:  So that's. That's you guys characters, at least.

100:59 Gary:  You know, in terms of mechanics.

101:00 Gary:  You got a class. You have an ancestry.

101:03 Gary:  A little bit of background was cool.

101:04 Gary:  You guys were starting to talk through some of that.

101:07 Gary:  I have a couple questions that we can do if you want to build some more bond between characters.

101:15 Chris:  I've got a mechanical question before we.

101:18 Chris:  Before we move on, and you might have just said this, but.

101:21 Chris:  So do we roll for attributes or do we not do that?

101:25 Gary:  You don't roll for happy weeks.

101:26 Gary:  Yeah.

101:27 Chris:  Okay, so like, that's our. We already have our modifiers.

101:29 Chris:  That's all we have for now.

101:31 Gary:  Yeah.

101:31 Braedon:  Okay.

101:32 Gary:  Yeah.

101:32 Chris:  So.

101:32 Gary:  So the event based in DD, right.

101:35 Gary:  When you rolled, like, you know, 3D6 or 4D6 and throw out the rolls.

101:40 Gary:  Right. And move those. You don't do that in Pathfinder at all.

101:42 Chris:  Okay.

101:43 Gary:  It's just the. The modifier to the attribute isn't all that this really matters.

101:48 Braedon:  Got it.

101:48 David:  Weird.

101:49 Braedon:  There's no luck involved.

101:51 Gary:  No luck. Yeah. You can pick the character you want based on the class and other things that you select

101:55 Gary:  and the boost that you select.

101:57 Gary:  So, yeah, feel free to like and we'll revisit a little bit.

102:04 Gary:  If you want to write your own background a little bit and send it to me or send it in

102:07 Gary:  the channel would be kind of cool for ideas you guys have.

102:10 Gary:  It sounds like we already have a few little things that might be good.

102:13 Gary:  I have what I created, like some random, what I said, PC Bond prompts, which if you guys want to,

102:23 Gary:  we could do a couple links between a couple characters and then we'll talk a little bit about when we

102:32 Gary:  want to play and other things like that, you know, at the end.

102:35 Gary:  And if you guys have any other last questions.

102:36 Gary:  But I initially thought I would do one random thing, connection between each player.

102:44 Gary:  But what I think I might do is kind of go around the horn and say.

102:48 Gary:  So I'll start with oded. Oded, who do you want to have a bond with?

102:52 Oded Welgreen:  I'm not sure if I know exactly what the other characters are.

102:55 Oded Welgreen:  Maybe we can, like, quickly recap.

102:59 Gary:  Sounds good. Okay, let's.

103:01 David:  Let's.

103:01 Gary:  I get you start and then we'll go to Vic and then David, Chris and then Odette.

103:07 Oded Welgreen:  I mean, sorry. Okay, so I'm thinking about the name Ginkgo.

103:11 Oded Welgreen:  I'm not sure yet. And as I mentioned, he's a scout.

103:17 Oded Welgreen:  He's collecting information about the Oni.

103:20 Oded Welgreen:  He's connected to other Leshy through the Mycelium.

103:24 Oded Welgreen:  And he has. He has, like, he knows about ecology.

103:29 Oded Welgreen:  He doesn't believe in spirits too much.

103:33 Oded Welgreen:  He more connects to like the circle of life, the decay and Death is part of life.

103:38 Oded Welgreen:  It's all just part of the one big ecosystem.

103:44 Gary:  Awesome. Vic, what do you got for your character?

103:51 Vic:  Nothing so detailed yet. So I don't generally play rogues and stuff, so I wanted to go different for this.

104:00 Vic:  So I went with a halfling rogue.

104:02 Vic:  That is an eager scofflaw, which gives me.

104:09 Vic:  I've got halfling luck, you know, I've got sneak attack and things like that.

104:17 Vic:  And I picked up a bunch of thieves related things.

104:21 Vic:  And so kind of thinking that I was either part of or married into or connected to the former ruling

104:28 Vic:  family. And when they fell on hard times, I went into thievery.

104:32 Gary:  And.

104:35 Vic:  Yeah, I don't know if I've worked it out much past that at this point that I'm not sure why

104:42 Vic:  I want to steal a bunch of stuff this time, but that's really what I'm looking forward to.

104:49 Gary:  Could be maybe there's some type of family artifact heirloom that you're searching for.

104:59 Gary:  Maybe you're not really a thief thief trying to make money, but maybe you're actually using those skills to find

105:04 Gary:  something that's been hidden from you.

105:07 Vic:  I also always have a bent towards more of the Robin Hood type.

105:12 Vic:  Thievery, giving back to people of the town where I would like to be stealing from the oni and helping

105:19 Vic:  gain information on the oni to then make life better.

105:22 Vic:  Better for much. Like, there's never an autocrat for good.

105:25 Vic:  There's never a thief for good.

105:27 Vic:  And I like to be the thief for good, you know, like, though I like that angle.

105:32 Gary:  Okay, sounds good. Cool. That's a good one.

105:36 Gary:  We got Chris.

105:40 Chris:  So my guy is really excited about this classic.

105:47 Chris:  This classic fighter. Exploring the fighter in Pathfinder.

105:51 Chris:  He is. And I'm just also excited about, like, he's an outsider.

105:56 Chris:  He's kind of like a stranger wandering in from the old West.

106:01 Chris:  His name is Boone. He's a dwarf.

106:04 Chris:  He is a fighter and has some experience.

106:07 Chris:  I don't know his connection maybe with some other character.

106:11 Chris:  Maybe they fought on the same side or different sides in some battle somewhere or some ongoing skirmishes or something

106:20 Chris:  like that. But that was, you know, that was years ago.

106:23 Chris:  And so he has left home.

106:27 Chris:  His children are grown. He's out looking for adventure.

106:31 Chris:  And he's wandered into this, you know, this sort of like diplomatic whatever's going on with the oni and the

106:37 Chris:  ruling family. And he is not a diplomat.

106:39 Chris:  He has no idea what's happening here.

106:44 Chris:  But he. Let's see, he's. He's strong.

106:48 Chris:  He let's see.

106:53 Gary:  Did something draw him to Willowshore? Was it a person? A.

106:57 Gary:  A legend? Like randomness?

107:00 Chris:  I think may. Yeah. I like the idea that he was curious about this change.

107:07 Chris:  Like it had been quiet for decades.

107:10 Chris:  He's heard about this, this new, you.

107:13 Braedon:  Know.

107:17 Chris:  Whatever you call it, the new oni leadership coming on board.

107:20 Chris:  He's kind of curious, like, okay, what's going on here? He wonders in.

107:28 Chris:  Yeah. See, figure out what else there is to say about him.

107:31 Chris:  I think that's about it. He's a.

107:33 Chris:  He likes hitting things. He hasn't done it in a while, but maybe he can, you know, get back into

107:40 Chris:  the swing of it.

107:41 Gary:  Okay, cool. Right, Dave?

107:45 David:  All right, so my character is he.

107:49 David:  He is an elf. I decided to go with elf for the ancestral longevity trait since it plays into the

107:56 David:  character. But he's so old and like there's definitely some human back in the woodpile.

108:02 David:  Like people aren't really sure if he's an elf or a human.

108:07 David:  He's been around town forever. No one knows why he's called Donkey, including himself.

108:12 David:  Like the name just came about and he didn't correct people.

108:17 David:  They didn't ask and it just kind of stuck.

108:21 David:  He. Nobody really knows where he lives.

108:24 David:  He really just lives off the land and brings herbs into town every so often to trade.

108:29 David:  But he will help people if they need help.

108:32 David:  And he's sort of like the village.

108:33 Oded Welgreen:  Witch.

108:36 David:  And like everybody seems to have had at least one conversation with him.

108:39 David:  But he also doesn't talk that much.

108:42 Gary:  Okay, cool. Awesome. Finally. Ray.

108:46 Oded Welgreen:  Wait, what's class or whatever? What? What class?

108:51 David:  Oh, he's a wizard.

108:52 Oded Welgreen:  A wizard.

108:53 Gary:  Okay.

108:55 Braedon:  I love that. That is a great character.

108:59 Braedon:  So mine is an orc investigator named Da Baishan, which is Chinese for big white mountain.

109:08 Oded Welgreen:  Love it.

109:10 Braedon:  He grew up in the caverns with the orcs and he was steeped in the orcish culture and the orcish

109:17 Braedon:  lore and eventually became a detective for the orcs and he would help police their society.

109:25 Braedon:  So he's well studied. He's somewhat scholarly, somewhat surprising for being an orc, like being a larger kind of brutish

109:33 Braedon:  looking creature. But he came to Willowshore because he finds the whole transition to the oni suspicious.

109:44 David:  Right.

109:45 Braedon:  He's untrusting of the oni coming out of the woodwork after 20 years, saying he'd always been there, like anything

109:53 Braedon:  about it. But he has studied the society well.

109:55 Braedon:  So well studied in the spirits and the.

109:58 Braedon:  And the imperial lore. So somewhat trying to blend in but not afraid to be the or Brute that everyone

110:06 Braedon:  sees when they look at them.

110:09 Gary:  Very cool. Awesome. Good, Good summaries.

110:14 Gary:  Way more detailed than. Than I would add.

110:17 Gary:  I have a. I think there's.

110:20 Gary:  We could do. If you guys see some logical ties, like, definitely call those out, but I was gonna have

110:27 Gary:  at least one tie. I have a random question that I was gonna have someone roll.

110:31 Gary:  It actually ties the two people at least to something in the setting, but if you have a better idea,

110:38 Gary:  definitely go for that. So, yeah, I think there's some.

110:43 Gary:  Some really cool storylines here that are going to be fun to play with, but I was going to do

110:49 Gary:  Odette. Do you want to have, like.

110:51 Gary:  Would you. Like, who would you like to be linked to? And do you want it to be one of

110:54 Gary:  my random ones, or do you have a thought for what you want to link your character to?

111:00 Oded Welgreen:  I think it makes the most sense to maybe to be.

111:03 Oded Welgreen:  To have a bond with Donkey.

111:05 Oded Welgreen:  I mean, who doesn't want to have a bond with Donkey?

111:10 Gary:  All right, do you want to roll the.

111:14 Gary:  I'm gonna roll the random, like, link, or do you have something that.

111:19 Oded Welgreen:  Like, what. What are, like, some options for links?

111:23 Gary:  I was going to randomly roll it.

111:24 Gary:  You don't even know what they are.

111:26 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, go for it.

111:28 Gary:  All right.

111:29 Braedon:  There it is.

111:29 Gary:  I love it. I love it.

111:31 Gary:  All right, all right. The. The two of you share a private tradition connected to a local rumor or festival.

111:40 Gary:  What is it and why must it remain private?

111:46 Braedon:  I can't wait to hear this.

111:50 Oded Welgreen:  Maybe it has to do with death, and it needs to be private because every.

111:57 Oded Welgreen:  Every creature is an island, and they need to go to the next phase of their cycle alone.

112:06 Oded Welgreen:  What do you think?

112:08 David:  Oh, yeah. So maybe so. I'm not sure what the war was, but Donkey was in the war back in

112:15 David:  the day, and maybe we both were, and it's just like a memorial of a battle we were in, and

112:26 David:  we both just kind of take the day off.

112:44 Gary:  Awesome. All right, Vic, you're next.

112:57 Vic:  I would say probably either a dead or Braden, based on.

113:06 Vic:  We're all investigating why the onis here are trying to do something against the oni.

113:17 Gary:  The.

113:17 Vic:  The old fighter coming in from out of somewhere.

113:23 Vic:  You know, I was trying to find a link to him where.

113:28 Gary:  You know.

113:29 Vic:  Maybe he had also had some unknown link to the.

113:32 Vic:  To the former ruling family, and him and I would find some shared connection there.

113:40 Vic:  I got stuck on Donkey's name and couldn't really think much past with the wizard and just kind of chuckled

113:48 Vic:  there. So I. I'm open to any of those, but like with both Braden and Odette, it's more of a.

113:54 Vic:  A shared interest in, you know, being suspicious and things of the oni.

114:01 Vic:  But the others. I'll go random, too.

114:03 Vic:  Like, I'm. I'm excited about that.

114:05 Vic:  That was fun.

114:06 Gary:  Okay, so who wants. Do you want Link to braid then? Or.

114:12 Gary:  Or do braid.

114:13 Vic:  Yeah, do braid. That way I can make fun of Braden all day at work and stuff too.

114:17 Gary:  There you go. That. Yeah, that'd be important.

114:19 Gary:  Yeah, because you. One more thing to make fun of him without, which is great.

114:23 Braedon:  I really like the idea of, you know, Vic's character was breaking in somewhere, and I discovered it and,

114:35 Braedon:  like, once I figured who he was, I was.

114:38 Braedon:  We're going to stick together.

114:41 Chris:  Nice.

114:42 Vic:  You caught me in doing. You were investigating oni and caught me doing something against ONI at the same time,

114:47 Vic:  and we're like, all right, yeah, I like it.

114:53 Braedon:  Forged in crime.

114:56 Gary:  Okay, cool. Oni related or

115:02 Gary:  ruling family related?

115:06 Gary:  You're breaking into something that was either only related or ruling family related.

115:10 Gary:  I mean, that's where you guys linked up and had that.

115:14 Gary:  That background. And as we play, we can figure out, you know, how you caught him or what it was.

115:20 Gary:  We need to detail it today.

115:22 Gary:  We can. We can have that.

115:24 Gary:  Uncover when you guys want to.

115:25 Gary:  Or decide what that would be.

115:28 Gary:  We got. Is Chris your a.

115:31 Gary:  What should the old dwarf, the pushy be? Tech, the dude? Do you have an idea or do you want

115:39 Gary:  it random?

115:43 Chris:  If anybody fought in whatever fun history you come up with for, you know, our previous battles, then I would

115:54 Chris:  have some connection either, you know, I don't know what the sides were in those battles, so it could be

116:00 Chris:  sort of interesting, like, oh, we were on opposite sides or we were on the same side for one or

116:05 Chris:  two of these people.

116:08 Gary:  We got two already for sure.

116:10 Gary:  Right. We got Donkey. And unless she were in some type of battle that they have a secret memorial that

116:19 Gary:  they commemorate. So one of those two would be good.

116:25 Gary:  Yeah, part of the same thing.

116:27 Gary:  You could be on the other side.

116:28 Gary:  If they were on the same side, they're obviously on the same floor.

116:30 Chris:  I think that makes sense. I think that makes sense.

116:32 Chris:  Maybe I was on the opposite side of the them.

116:34 Gary:  Okay.

116:35 Braedon:  I love that. That's going to be fun.

116:39 Oded Welgreen:  So we'll.

116:40 Gary:  We'll say, oh, dead.

116:49 Gary:  You were on the opposite.

116:59 Gary:  Who won this battle?

117:01 Oded Welgreen:  You're.

117:02 Gary:  You're the one who's doing this story.

117:04 Gary:  So do you want to be on the Victoria side or the vanquished side? Chris.

117:15 Chris:  Probably the losing side. I mean, maybe.

117:18 Chris:  Maybe we don't really agree on who won and who lost.

117:21 Chris:  It's kind of like that earlier story was like, you know, how did it.

117:23 Chris:  How did things shake out? But I definitely wasn't on the winning side.

117:26 Chris:  Side, and I wonder if anybody was on the winning side.

117:28 Gary:  We'll call it a time.

117:30 David:  We all think that we're on the losing side and are maybe bitter about.

117:35 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, there are no winners.

117:36 Chris:  That's great.

117:37 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah.

117:37 Vic:  We're all.

117:37 Chris:  We're all.

117:38 Gary:  Yeah.

117:39 Chris:  Old embittered veterans, regardless of what we were, what side we were on.

117:46 Chris:  That's right.

117:47 Gary:  Cool. All right, we got. Let's see.

117:53 Gary:  David, I think you get to pick your lines and find the.

117:57 Gary:  Braden.

118:01 David:  Do you say with Braden?

118:04 Gary:  No, you get to pick one.

118:05 Gary:  Oh.

118:10 David:  Braden. You're fairly new in town, right? Or how long have you been here?

118:15 Braedon:  Relatively new. Like, I. I came when I heard that the oni was returning but had always been there.

118:23 Braedon:  When that news reached the orc site, I journeyed to town, suspicious of what's going on.

118:31 Braedon:  So we've definitely.

118:33 Gary:  He's here long enough to catch Vic doing something bad.

118:36 Braedon:  Right. And we definitely have running his mad Donkey.

118:41 David:  Yeah. And I would have made a point to catch you at the bar.

118:46 Gary:  Mm. Yeah.

118:47 Braedon:  I don't blend in. Mm.

118:54 David:  I think we probably would have tried to pull some kind of caper.

119:00 Braedon:  Because.

119:02 David:  I'm not exactly sure how Donkey feels about the oni coming in, but.

119:13 Gary:  I don't know.

119:14 David:  I also think that I would have, like, availed myself as a source of information just because I find you

119:21 David:  interesting and want to see what you do.

119:23 Chris:  With it.

119:26 Braedon:  You know? And I would have gotten up to any hijinks that got me more information on this case.

119:36 David:  I think maybe I told you something that was technically true but, like, incomplete in some way, and, like, it

119:49 David:  got you into a situation where you barely got out.

119:53 David:  And, like, it was true. And maybe it was helpful for your investigation, but, like, was Donkey trying to kill

120:00 David:  me?

120:02 Braedon:  And I'm still slightly miffed that you pulled one over on me.

120:09 Braedon:  Like, that. Just digs at me a little bit.

120:12 David:  Just want to see if you got what it takes.

120:16 David:  You want to play hardball in Will ashore?

120:23 Gary:  Don't know what that information is, but there's so.

120:27 Gary:  It sounds like there is. I don't know if I'd say animosity, but definitely some questioned loyalties, maybe between Braden's

120:38 Gary:  character and David's character.

120:40 David:  Like, I'm definitely one of his sources.

120:44 Gary:  Okay.

120:44 David:  But not the easiest one.

120:47 Gary:  You respect him because he hasn't a lot of knowledge.

120:49 Gary:  Braden, he's been around. You're someone who's scholarly as well.

120:53 Gary:  He brings, like, feet on the ground.

120:57 Gary:  Experience and understanding. But you're not exactly sure if you trust everything he says.

121:01 Gary:  Maybe something like that. Okay.

121:03 Braedon:  Trust him. Not yet.

121:10 David:  How can two people so different possibly get along?

121:16 Gary:  Braden, you're. You're last there. Who would you like your relationship with? Another character? Beam.

121:23 Gary:  And then you want random, or do you have an idea?

121:27 Braedon:  So I've got connections with and I forget Vic's character's name.

121:36 Gary:  Yes. Yeah.

121:41 Braedon:  Be careful, Vic. We'll give him a name.

121:43 Braedon:  You don't.

121:45 Vic:  I put Littlefinger in as a placeholder.

121:47 Vic:  I'm gonna do some research and think about it, though.

121:51 David:  I feel like everyone at this table should know what placeholder name's doing.

121:56 Braedon:  Yes. So I think Boone is pretty straightforward to me.

122:03 Braedon:  Like, likes to fight, loves a good scrap.

122:06 Braedon:  Kind of wandered in with the wins.

122:08 Braedon:  But was it Genko Odette's character?

122:12 Oded Welgreen:  Ginkgo.

122:13 Braedon:  Ginkgo. I think that'd be an interesting one to have a connection, too.

122:18 Braedon:  Yeah, I think. A random connection.

122:22 Gary:  What?

122:23 Braedon:  I think we'll. I think we'll roll the dice on a random.

122:25 Gary:  Roll the dice. You got one of ten chances.

122:30 Gary:  Let's. Okay.

122:47 Braedon:  Uhoh.

122:48 Gary:  I know it's a little longer than.

122:51 Gary:  Okay, so this one.

122:56 Gary:  One of you saw something forbidden or otherworldly near the river at night, and the other helped hide it.

123:07 Gary:  What did you. And why did you trust this person?

123:14 Braedon:  So Ginkgo doesn't really believe in the spirits.

123:17 Braedon:  Right. He thinks it's all part of a natural cycle of life and death.

123:22 Oded Welgreen:  I think he. He's. He doesn't know exactly what he feels about spirits.

123:29 Oded Welgreen:  He definitely doesn't fit with his, like, what? World philosophy, but he can't deny that something is going on.

123:38 Braedon:  So I'm thinking. I'm thinking Ginkgo had the encounter with the.

123:44 Braedon:  With the spirit. And by happenstance, I was also at the river.

123:51 Braedon:  And, like, it was more of a.

123:55 Braedon:  Like a proximity thing that. That forced the trust than anything.

124:03 Gary:  In this one.

124:08 Gary:  What did you hide then? So the.

124:12 Gary:  Up with the thing. That's. That's so very detail.

124:15 Braedon:  But what if there was a.

124:19 Braedon:  What if there's a third person at the river and the spirit.

124:22 Braedon:  Blum. And we hit the body to let it decompose.

124:31 David:  And not tell anyone.

124:33 Braedon:  And not tell anyone. Because Ginkgo said this natural part of life.

124:38 Braedon:  And he didn't want to.

124:41 Vic:  He didn't want the people part of the shared ritual.

124:46 Braedon:  Yeah. He didn't Want to come in and, like, have the people.

124:48 Braedon:  People, like, burn the body or anything.

124:50 Braedon:  He wanted to let the body decompose and return to nature, maybe.

124:55 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, I like that. Ginkgo would feel strongly about letting the body decompose.

125:02 Oded Welgreen:  Maybe something with the oni they wanted to.

125:08 Oded Welgreen:  Or they would take the body away to do something with it, like something unnatural.

125:15 Oded Welgreen:  And Ginkgo cannot allow that to happen.

125:18 Braedon:  Cremated or something.

125:21 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, I guess cremated, yeah.

125:24 David:  There could be a local legend that if you die in the woods or you die by a spirit, then

125:31 David:  your body can come back or be controlled by the spirit.

125:36 David:  So the body has to be disposed of in some way that, you know, a regular person wouldn't be.

125:42 David:  So they wouldn't get a proper burial.

125:44 Braedon:  Yeah, Some ritual or something. But we decided to just leave the body, hide it and leave it and tell

125:52 Braedon:  no one of this or give.

125:54 David:  It a proper burial.

125:56 Braedon:  Yeah, right. And we decided to trust each other because when he explained his.

126:03 Braedon:  His viewpoint to me, it was intriguing to me.

126:07 Braedon:  It was something I hadn't encountered before.

126:09 Braedon:  It was interesting and new knowledge, and, you know, I was like, all right, let's.

126:15 Braedon:  Let's try it. Let's experience it.

126:18 Oded Welgreen:  Nice.

126:20 Gary:  Yeah. All right. So there was a body next to a spirit.

126:27 Gary:  Legend is that death next to a spirit, the body will return or something dire will happen.

126:35 Gary:  Unless it's dealt with properly. You didn't.

126:40 Gary:  Because of the beliefs of Gingo.

126:44 Gary:  Okay,

126:48 Gary:  awesome. That's the last one. So we have, hopefully you guys starting to get some decent threads of stories for

126:57 Gary:  each character amongst each other. A little bit, even a little bit of the setting, and we'll play out the

127:02 Gary:  campaign and see what happens. In terms of.

127:06 Gary:  We usually play. This is what we did in the past.

127:08 Gary:  So Vic and Chris, if this works for you guys, we played on Thursday nights, like 7:30 to about 9:30,

127:14 Gary:  10. Sometimes later, not later than 10.

127:18 Gary:  That would be like, usually that Braden is up there Eastern time, so we gotta let him get some sleep.

127:24 Gary:  So that's usually the window that we played and we tried to do every week or at least we scheduled

127:28 Gary:  it. We weren't super consistent, but that was kind of the deal.

127:33 Gary:  So if you guys, we could try every week or every other week.

127:37 Gary:  I think we generally met every other week.

127:39 Gary:  So depending on what you guys want to do, if that window of time works for everybody, we could keep

127:44 Gary:  that. If a different day works, we can discuss that as well.

127:49 Gary:  The other thing that we'll talk about is generally, at least with a group this size, if one person's missing.

127:54 Gary:  We'll still play that day. So if, you know, Braden can't make it that day, but everybody else can.

128:00 Gary:  We'll still play. We'll catch up Braden after that.

128:03 Gary:  If two people are out, then we usually just cancel the session and meet next time.

128:08 Gary:  So that's kind of our little standard rules there.

128:12 Gary:  And then I think in terms of, you know, subject matter, I'm not sure if there's anything's off limits, but

128:19 Gary:  if you guys have something, definitely let me know.

128:21 Gary:  I guess I'm usually I. If I say PG to R somewhere in there, it's usually not too crazy.

128:27 Gary:  But we do have some fun with.

128:33 Gary:  With. With different things. Sometimes it gets a little darker, other times not.

128:38 Gary:  But I would say we. We have a very graphic.

128:43 Gary:  Even just depictions of things. So.

128:46 Gary:  But I'm trying to think for something else.

128:50 Gary:  I think that was really it.

128:52 Gary:  We'd agree on, like, what the next when session one should be and standard work week.

128:56 Gary:  If that works for everybody. That's kind of what we did in the past.

128:59 Gary:  So open up to you guys and see what works for you guys for logistics of the group.

129:07 Chris:  That all works for me.

129:09 Gary:  Y. Yep. Thursday. All right.

129:13 Braedon:  I like Thursdays because then, you know, most of us work from home on Fridays.

129:18 Gary:  Yep.

129:19 Braedon:  I think at least we used to.

129:21 Braedon:  And so if it's a little bit of a later night, no big deal.

129:26 Gary:  Sounds good. So we'll do Thursdays, 7:30.

129:29 Gary:  Like 9:30, 10. Somewhere there is usually when we end it.

129:32 Gary:  That's not good.

129:33 Unknown:  Okay.

129:35 Gary:  You want to try. Is the.

129:38 Gary:  What's next the 22nd? Do we want to try to start on the 22nd? You guys want a week starting

129:45 Gary:  the 29th. A week to look at other things, maybe finish your character, get a better understanding there.

129:51 Gary:  Or just start off in the 22nd.

129:54 Oded Welgreen:  I'm probably gonna be out on the 29th.

129:57 Gary:  Okay.

129:58 Oded Welgreen:  So if we can start on 20.

130:00 Oded Welgreen:  22nd. At least I will have the first session.

130:03 Gary:  Okay.

130:03 Braedon:  Do it good with that 22nd.

130:06 Vic:  It is.

130:07 Gary:  That's good to me. Everybody else?

130:10 Braedon:  Yeah, Molly's. Molly's in. Where was that ice shooting? She's going to that city for work, coincidentally.

130:18 David:  Minneapolis. Minneapolis.

130:19 Braedon:  That one. Thank you. She's going there for work.

130:22 Gary:  Great.

130:23 Braedon:  Great timing. Feels awesome.

130:24 Vic:  Yeah, that's super great timing.

130:26 Braedon:  Yep. On Thursday. So I'll be free.

130:28 Braedon:  I'll be here a lot.

130:30 Gary:  Okay. All right. Well, cool. All right.

130:32 Gary:  So 22nd, 7:30. We'll kick off the.

130:36 Gary:  Whatever we want to call this band of crazy will ashore characters.

130:41 Gary:  Awesome. Any last things before we Head out.

130:44 Gary:  Any questions? Anything else? No.

130:48 Braedon:  Chris, anything you want to know? I think you're the.

130:51 Braedon:  Probably the one who knows the least about the rest of us.

130:59 Chris:  No, he told me nothing. So.

131:01 Chris:  I mean, you all used to work together originally.

131:06 Chris:  Is that the idea?

131:07 Braedon:  Yeah, yeah, we've all worked at Assuran.

131:11 Braedon:  Vic and I still do. We've somehow.

131:15 Vic:  Gary, I can provide you an update on the connect migration if you like.

131:19 Vic:  We just had a huge win yesterday.

131:20 Vic:  We got AT&T at 100%, buddy.

131:23 Braedon:  We're done.

131:24 Gary:  Very good.

131:25 Vic:  Yeah, Chris, we're.

131:27 Gary:  I'm still there.

131:31 Chris:  And do you really do voices? I'm all about voices, but I mean, you don't do.

131:36 Braedon:  All right.

131:37 Gary:  So. Yeah, I appreciate you asking that.

131:40 Braedon:  Thank you.

131:43 Gary:  Yeah, so I. I cannot do voices.

131:47 Gary:  I'll do sometimes inflections a little bit, just slightly change, like the way I talk a bit.

131:53 Gary:  But my. My voice, I definitely don't do accents.

131:57 Gary:  I'm horrible at that.

131:58 Unknown:  So.

131:58 Gary:  So you'll basically get this adolescent voice throughout the whole thing with a slight variation.

132:04 Gary:  But I'll try to talk as the character would talk, like, so hopefully you guys get when the character's talking

132:11 Gary:  as opposed to when I. I'm talking.

132:12 Gary:  But. But yeah, I don't do a whole lot.

132:14 Gary:  I'm not. I'm not a trained actor or anything like that.

132:17 Gary:  So I don't have that. That skill.

132:20 Gary:  If you guys do go at it, that's awesome.

132:23 Gary:  I do try to use character names and stuff like.

132:25 Vic:  So.

132:26 Gary:  So I do that. We do have.

132:28 Gary:  I don't know if. I'd say we're probably a.

132:31 Gary:  A decent mix. I'd say combat and role playing.

132:33 Gary:  Like, we've had some sessions where there's been zero combat in them.

132:37 Gary:  We've had some sessions where like that's took up most of the session.

132:41 Gary:  So I think we tend to enjoy some of the, you know, the non combat sections.

132:46 Gary:  There's several folks here who. Braden's character was one of those.

132:49 Gary:  David does that. Odette as well too, that kind of embrace like their character and feel like, you know, what

132:56 Gary:  their character would do in this world.

132:57 Gary:  So if you guys talk amongst each other in character, I'll stay out of it, you know, and let you

133:02 Gary:  guys talk a few other stuff.

133:04 Gary:  So I, I enjoy all that too.

133:06 Gary:  But yeah, I don't do voices.

133:08 Gary:  Sure. And I don't expect you guys to either.

133:12 David:  I mean, am I just the greatest character? But we got all the Megans of the classic whodunit.

133:18 Braedon:  True. Yeah. But you can't trust most of what I say.

133:22 Braedon:  Chris, Vic knows this, and most of the other guys don't trust a lot of what I say.

133:28 Chris:  Okay, good to know.

133:30 Vic:  I'm excited about it. This is gonna be fun, y'.

133:32 Gary:  All. This is gonna be fun.

133:34 Gary:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, cool

133:40 Gary:  then if there's anything else. Yeah, and we can use it, you know, any questions on.

133:45 Gary:  You can post my discord or anything like that.

133:48 Vic:  Oh, Odette, you're gonna share the summary.

133:50 Vic:  You're gonna share the.

133:52 Oded Welgreen:  I'll. Yeah, I'll whip something up.

133:54 Vic:  We have spinach help here. Is that what you were doing? We using spinach to do this? What are we

133:57 Vic:  doing then?

133:57 Gary:  What's happening?

133:58 Oded Welgreen:  Yeah, that's. That's exactly it.

134:02 Vic:  I knew it. I know. I love it.

134:04 Vic:  I'm excited to see the results.

134:05 Vic:  That's cool. That is very cool.

134:07 David:  Nice.

134:07 Gary:  They're really good. Yeah, thanks.

134:09 Braedon:  Turn out great.

134:11 Gary:  I'm glad to hear that.

134:12 Chris:  So.

134:13 Vic:  Man, that is so cool.

134:15 Oded Welgreen:  Gary.

134:17 Vic:  Is that what.

134:20 Chris:  No, no, I will. So Oda and I met because our.

134:26 Chris:  My daughter's about the exact same age as his younger daughter.

134:29 Chris:  And so our families met at a park near where we used to work.

134:35 Chris:  And our wives became good friends.

134:36 Chris:  And so that was now. Well, I mean, Juni's seven and Mila, I guess, is seven.

134:44 Chris:  So, you know, that was about seven years ago.

134:48 Chris:  Right on.

134:49 Braedon:  That's cool.

134:54 Gary:  You had something.

134:57 Oded Welgreen:  If you wrote down any notes, Gary, please share them and I'll incorporate them as well.

135:04 Oded Welgreen:  Is there a way to do like a wiki in demiplane or.

135:11 Gary:  Yeah, I don't think so.

135:12 Braedon:  There.

135:13 Gary:  There might be. There's like a campaign notes.

135:15 Gary:  I'm not sure if it's open everybody and how well it formats, but we could.

135:20 Gary:  Maybe inside of Discord might be easier or.

135:28 Oded Welgreen:  I might find a way to organize notes in a more interactive way.
