Da Baishan of the White Mountain

Baishan was raised beneath stone.

He was born in the cavern networks where the orc clans of Chu Ye carved their homes into the bones of the earth. Among his people, strength was respected—but endurance was revered. Elders taught that the mountain does not rush, does not shout, and does not move without cause. Baishan learned early that the strongest orc was not the one who struck first, but the one who understood why the strike was coming.

Unlike many of his kin, Baishan was educated deliberately. He learned clan histories, ancestral customs, and the unwritten laws that kept blood feuds from becoming extinction events. Orc justice was not gentle, but it was precise. Someone had to remember debts, lies, and patterns. Someone had to notice when tradition was being bent for convenience.

That someone became Baishan.

As a detective among the orcs, Baishan kept his people in line—not through fear, but through inevitability. When a crime occurred, he did not ask who was guilty. He asked who benefited, who stayed silent, and who changed their habits afterward. Few escaped his notice, and fewer tried twice.

When the Oni appeared—after generations of absence—and overthrew the old ruling order, Baishan did not celebrate. Power that arrives suddenly and claims inevitability always hides a cost. While others accepted the new hierarchy, Baishan watched. He listened. And when answers did not come, he left the caverns to investigate for himself.

That trail led him to Willowshore.
Willowshore and Its Fault Lines

Baishan arrived in Willowshore not as an enforcer, but as an observer. The town’s customs were rigid, its traditions brittle. Where orcs accepted decay as part of the cycle, Willowshore demanded order and ceremony—even when the land itself resisted it.

His investigations quickly entangled him with others.

He caught Littlefinger committing a crime against the Oni—cleanly, unmistakably. The evidence was sound, the motive obvious. Rather than turn Littlefinger in, Baishan recognized a shared suspicion. An alliance formed, not from trust, but from aligned doubt.

By the river, Baishan witnessed something that unsettled him more deeply: a spirit killing a mortal in full view of the living world. He and Ginko stood as witnesses. Ginko’s leshy beliefs—that death fed life, that decay was not corruption but transformation—stood in stark opposition to Willowshore’s funerary laws. Against local custom, Baishan agreed to hide the body in the forest and allow it to return to the cycle. It was a calculated risk. One he still weighs.

At a tavern, Baishan crossed paths with Donkey, an ancient elf who spoke a truth so carefully framed that it led Baishan into public embarrassment. The statement was technically accurate—and deeply misleading. Baishan does not forget such things. Deception masked as wisdom is still deception.

Who Baishan Is Now

Baishan remains in Willowshore because the answers are not finished revealing themselves.

He is an orc who understands people better than they understand themselves. A detective who trusts patterns over proclamations. A mountain given legs—slow to move, impossible to ignore once he does.

He does not threaten.
He explains.

And when the truth surfaces, as it always does, Baishan is already standing where it will break.
