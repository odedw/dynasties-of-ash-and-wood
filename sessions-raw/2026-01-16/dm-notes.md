When the new mayor (the Oni) arrives, what tradition must be observed to keep the peace and who in town refuses to take part?

You cannot be allow to look on the Oni as they enter town. ‘Ive always been here’.
The Revival of Friendship is a traditional rite observed at every change of power (a new store manager or a new mayor) where old grudges are publicly put to rest. The current prominent and de-facto ruler family is refusing to attend the festival, to perform an unofficial but very customary Transfer of Power.

What is the oldest story villagers whisper about the forest shadows and why does nobody ever say the story’s ending aloud?

Beware the wisps in the forest which can lead other into the woods who are too drunk to know the ending is never agreed upon. Too many fights start. Secretly blame each other. ( maybe ending embarrassed the defacto family this is why nobody will tell the ending. Some agree with Oni coming in and this started a faction war. Heir to the ruling family fortune - officially lured by spirits from the forest. On crusade to rid forest of spirits. Heir was just drunk. Father losing face and spun this yarn.
