Most Avistani are familiar with the departure of  Asmodeus from Heaven, a migration that changed him and his followers into devils. The dichotomy between righteous celestials and profane fiends is thus often taken for granted and further enforced by dramatic tales of angels falling from grace. In Tian Xia, a celestial\u2019s behavior has little to do with their status as a creature of Heaven. Even a banished godling or a drunken priest can still conjure incredible sacred powers.</p> <p>Appearances are deceiving. Shapeshifters abound in Tian Xia, and no one can be certain if a priest or merchant they\u2019re talking to is really who they seem to be. Kitsune move through cities wearing human faces, tanuki hide as teakettles or statues, and rats who snatch a stray fingernail can turn into someone\u2019s doppelganger. Even Tian Xia\u2019s goblins, known as dokkaebi, are known to transform into other forms, often appearing as attractive but troublesome members of other ancestries.</p> <p>Dragons aren\u2019t monsters. Heroic tales of Taldan knights facing down dragons are common entertainment in Avistan\u2014but in Tian Xia, dragons aren\u2019t massive beasts to slay. They\u2019re people, just like humans, nagaji, tengu, elves, and others who live upon the continent. They\u2019ve served as rulers, advisors, guardians, and spiritual leaders across history, and they\u2019re chosen agents of the Empress of Heaven. If a Tian person comes into conflict with a dragon, their first thought usually isn\u2019t how to kill it, but how to negotiate with it.</p> <p>Spirits aren\u2019t abstract. Elsewhere in the world, spirits are often insubstantial and thus remain out of mind for the average person. Those who know how to call to these strange entities can wield incredible power, but most will never see a spirit beyond a stray leshy or a summoned eidolon. In Tian Xia, kami walk the forests, anito teem in the jungles, and yakshas help in the villages\u2014tangible beings that feel very real. Offending the spirit of a river is much more serious when that river spirit might manifest as a dragon in response!</p> <p>The dead are never truly gone. In many philosophies, a soul is judged by  Pharasma, then moves on to its final reward. In Tian Xia, ancestors linger, watching their family and affecting their fortunes. Village heroes can straddle the line between ghost and god; sages who cultivate their spirit can even transcend mortality. The Celestial Court of Tian Xia also offers a different path for those who choose it: reincarnation. Much like history, souls move around the universe in circles, and death isn\u2019t always a permanent ending.</p>"},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#playing-a-character-from-tian-xia","title":"Playing a Character from Tian Xia","text":"<ul> <li>Backgrounds:  </li> <li>You might be a wandering samurai, exiled prince, farmhand\u2019s child, monastery student, trader, or even a kitsune in disguise.  </li> <li>Ancestries:  </li> <li>Classic ancestries (human, elf, dwarf, etc.) mingle with kitsune, tengu (birdfolk), nagaji (serpentfolk), samsarans, and more\u2014each with deep roots in Tian Xia.  </li> <li>Connections:  </li> <li>Family, clan, or spiritual tradition might influence your story: who owes you a debt, what ancient duty must you fulfill, which spirits watch over you?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#what-should-i-expect","title":"What Should I Expect?","text":"<ul> <li>Adventure hooks built on culture:  </li> <li>Monsters and magic are as likely to come from folklore, ancestral curses, or bureaucratic intrigue as from a rampaging ogre.  </li> <li>Honor and reputation matter:  </li> <li>Sometimes, how you act or are perceived can be as important as success in a quest.  </li> <li>Legends walk among us:  </li> <li>The old stories are true\u2014wise dragons, fierce oni, and celestial bureaucrats may cross your path.  </li> <li>Many paths, many styles:  </li> <li>Whether you seek kung fu duels, grand wars, lonely pilgrimages, merchant intrigue, or mystical mysteries, Tian Xia has room for every kind of hero.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#a-glimpse-of-the-realms","title":"A Glimpse of the Realms","text":"<ul> <li>Goka: Trade hub, city of wonders, crossroads of cultures\u2014think \u201cImperial Hong Kong.\u201d  </li> <li>Kaoling: Empire ruled by hobgoblins; ambitious, militaristic, a land of discipline and war.  </li> <li>Po Li: Home of unique traditions, bureaucracy, and ancient magic; known for wisdom and patience.  </li> <li>Xa Hoi: Ruled by descendants of dragons, famous for devotion and stoicism.  </li> <li>Valley of Spirits: Home to kitsune, kami, and mystical phenomena\u2014a place where reality is thin.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#things-to-know","title":"Things To Know","text":"<ul> <li>Names &amp; Pronouns: It\u2019s okay if you stumble over names.  </li> <li>Respect for Cultures: Tian Xia draws from many Asian inspirations, but it\u2019s a fantasy setting first.  </li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#chu-ye","title":"Chu Ye","text":""},{"location":"resources/Player%20Guide/#empire-of-blood","title":"Empire of Blood","text":"<p>Chu Ye\u2019s history is perhaps best summarized by the saying, \u201ckind hearts attract poisoned blood.\u201d Acupuncture began in the region, and its medical innovations delivered miracles compared to traditional remedies.

When Imperial Lung Wa fell, these corrupted nature spirits saw an opportunity to reveal their true forms and conquer the nation. A century of their cruel rule has brought Chu Ye to the brink, its healing hands now sticky with its own blood.</p> <p>Today the region is a land of extreme contrasts. The oni and their favored mortals cavort amid a dragon\u2019s hoard of wealth while 90 percent of the population don\u2019t have a copper to their name. Propaganda praises Chu Ye as a land of opportunity where hard work can earn any humanoid a position in the ruling ranks, but authorities also warn that jealous neighbors besiege the nation from all sides.

Wealthy humanoids are also welcome. The city of Kirahata is a playground for the rich and powerful. Casinos, pleasure palaces, and hunting lodges line its beaches. Some powerful visitors enjoy Chu Ye\u2019s excesses so much they become permanent residents. Human-appearing oni compete to lure the wealthiest to become ranking officials in their municipalities, enabling the oni to run grifts as low-level authorities.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a rebellion is taking shape in the shadows. Mizu Ki Hikari is a human resistance organization based in Chuyokai Forest. The darkness deep within is so terrible it keeps the oni away, and an ambitious general seeks to weaponize it. Humans have also found unlikely allies in immigrant wayangs who find themselves empathizing with the oppressed. Tengu from Kwanlai seeking to preserve Chu Ye\u2019s medical knowledge are smuggling supplies in by sea while the rise of an underworld dragon under the Nightford Mountains destabilizes oni power.

Then there are the Nightford Mountains, a once-dormant volcano range that now paints the sky red and the earth ashen. The diverse geography yields many natural resources, but Chu Ye\u2019s decaying infrastructure leaves it unable to benefit. Potholes and overgrown roads hinder transportation from mountain mines. Mismanagement of crop rotation has rendered farms in the north unproductive. Seafood is the country\u2019s primary source of nourishment, but poorly maintained boats make every fishing trip a deadly gamble.</p> <p>An eerie silence dominates Chuyokai. The stench of rotting flesh rises with each step upon the soft forest floor where bodies of undead animals wait beneath fallen leaves. Occasionally a sob might break the quiet: the cry of a grave kami remembering its past. Those who hear it would do well to take cover, otherwise the kami might initiate a hunt for living prey, its every move accompanied by the sound of cracking joints.

They are coming to that realization, even if this epiphany is but a seedling in their subconscious. In the cold peaks of Nightford, snow oni reread ancient monk texts and train their bodies until days blend into years, but for how many hours can one flex at one\u2019s own reflection before realizing an immortal at peak fitness has simply stagnated? How many decades can caldera oni inhale the sulfur of fire giant forges, honing their war cries and polishing their weapons, before wondering if glorious war will ever come?</p> <p>Gods come in and out of fashion, mainly due to Kirahata\u2019s brothels. </p> <p>Lymnieris was popular before oni took control, but they took his iconography down once they realized he frowned on all the evil deeds they commit. Calistria lasted several decades, though Lady Nanbyo could claim an equal stake with all the flooding and shaking that occurred. Fumeiyoshi had a decent run after oni complained that the most experienced and talented humans kept dying, until the smell got to be too much. Desperation led to hiring other oni, enticed by good money in the business, but that led to the Cayden Cailean years, which went by in a blur. Recovering from that era has meant that lustful oni can no longer blame hangovers for climaxes feeling like nadirs. Worship of Lymnieris and Arshea has crept back in as the sea oni, favoring decadence in all things, hypothesize that pleasure is better when all parties involved experience it.</p> <p>That mentality is spurring a renaissance everywhere, giving humans hope they can improve their lot in life. Dancers begin their days with stretching and a full meal, emphasizing health as much as form. Sea oni guard their favorite artisans to ensure they have nothing to fear, recognizing steady hands lead to beautiful melodies, soft weaves, and innovative paintings. Even in blood sports, fighters give their all, hoping the shogun\u2019s agents will choose them for the elite guards. A guard\u2019s day ends with a bow and encouragement to improve, rather than a brutal death. The shogun has acknowledged that these new recruits are better sparring partners, having the luxury to develop skill when they aren\u2019t replaced every day.</p> <p>The oni rulers also discovered that creating a favored class solidifies their power. Posters and town criers used to threaten punishment for disobedience, but now they promote beautiful celebrities and vacation destinations. If someone is poor, they imply, that\u2019s their personal failing. Oni elites have rebranded themselves as benefactors, not dictators. Night oni shepherd giants into cities to repair infrastructure, basking in the praise they receive for their subordinates\u2019 labor.

Cold, dry northern air sweeps down from Hongal\u2019s tundra for half the year, creating autumn frosts that evaporate into desiccated winters. Spring delivers a reversal of fortune as southeastern winds bring monsoon rains from Xidao\u2019s sea. Summers are so humid that laundry remains damp under the noon sun.</p> <p>Citizens without access to magic are at the mercy of the weather and plan their lives accordingly. Those who pay their oni overlords or licensed spellcasters for relief often find the price higher than they anticipate. Some oni crave the flesh of humanoids while others find thrill in hunting them, but the shogun imposed a limit on such behavior to keep their lifestyle sustainable. Now each region holds a sacrificial lottery each equinox to cull one percent of the population. Noble or foolhardy humanoids may volunteer to replace someone whose name comes up. Any selected humanoid who survives the hunting grounds until the next equinox returns home having earned immunity from the lottery for themselves and their immediate family. A lucrative black market exists to find debtors willing to volunteer for the lottery in exchange for paying off their bills.</p> <p>Rice is a major crop thanks to early summer floods followed by meltwater from the Nightford Mountains. Many annual festivals revolve around tilling and harvesting, but have been twisted by oni influence. What used to be the spring planting festival is now a week celebrating the military and the sacrifices people make for Chu Ye. Soldiers in dress uniforms parade through each city alongside the latest siege weaponry. Ordinary citizens prepare for weeks to sing and dance in public squares under the gaze of their oni overlords. They then rush home to work their fields by moonlight.</p> <p>Ghost Month occurs at the peak of summer and doubles as a sacred time for Fumeiyoshi. Legend holds that the gods agreed even the worst spirits deserve respite from their fates. Thus the dead visit during the month when daytime lasts longest, limiting the damage hungry ghosts can do. During this time, even oni avoid leaving their homes at night, believing that ghosts can trade places with the living\u2014an evil spirit can stay when the month ends if they claim a victim to return to the Lower Planes in their stead. Good spirits can also return, and people make shrines in their homes to seek guidance from ancestors and lost friends.</p> <p>Few ever report seeing a ghost, causing skeptics to hypothesize that Ghost Month is a superstition. </p> <p>The harvest festival is a time for feasts, and fresh mochi is the highlight. Each village has a signature flavor and tithes a portion to ruling oni. Talented mochi makers might acquire an oni patron and emerge unscathed from the semiannual lotteries. Rice cakes and boat races are popular along the coast, while kite battles entertain those inland.</p> <p>An ice festival is the highlight of winter. It originated from the practice of bringing ice slabs down from the Nightford Mountains to replenish water supplies. Bored villagers carved them into sculptures to decorate the streets while melting. The practice has become extravagant under oni rule, to please oni sensibilities and forestall death at their hands. Every region competes to make the most intricate sculptures.

The gods abandoned them, after all, punishing them for failures beyond their control. They see their accomplishments as personal triumphs that they achieved despite starting at a disadvantage. This perspective leads oni to view failure and misfortune as the result of personal deficiencies.

Generous bounties for reporting suspected rebels eradicated most resistance efforts, but the rebels regrouped and realized they needed to offer people a tangible reason to risk their lives for freedom. The resistance has a new strategy that focuses on three elements: stage high-profile robberies to make oni look weak, redistribute their stolen wealth to improve the lives of humanoids, and look impressive while doing it. Operatives wear immaculate white robes with red trim, and veiled conical hats to protect their identity. They speak rarely and make grand entrances, timing their appearances to avoid run-ins with authority figures. This strategy caused their popularity to soar, and even humans who cast their lot with oni often politely ignore rebel activities.</p> <p>Acupuncture originated in Chu Ye, alongside the study of qi, the energy that flows through meridian lines in the body. Some external forces such as disease or poor eating habits slow down or block qi, while others such as heat can energize it.

Visiting diplomats see a nation dominated by the oni shogunate, but their minders curate their itineraries to give that impression.

He convenes a ruling council in the capital city of Jyito once a year to discuss affairs of state. It is a lavish event that appeals to the hedonistic nature of oni, making its attendance something officials desire instead of dread. Two lieutenants manage day-to-day governance: Stewards Imora (brutal female storm oni marshal) and Tanyo (precise male void oni councilor). Imora oversees the military while Tanyo manages bureaucrats. Fumeiyoshan fanatics follow Kana (bombastic female merfolk cleric), who preaches devotion to the Lord of Envy above all.</p> <p></p> <p>Tamami</p> <p>Several factions exist among the ruling council. Tsuneni enjoys pitting them against each other and finds their differing opinions useful in determining the best direction for the nation.

On the other side of the political spectrum sits Shiga (contemplative male storm oni governor). His shinkaze faction consists of former kami who lost their position due to failures beyond their control. They hope either to redeem themselves and become kami again, or to create a new order of gods who accept them despite their failings. This faction is isolationist and focuses on spiritual evolution. Tamami (debauched female village oni governor) leads the hedonist faction and is the only councilor who doesn\u2019t want to be shogun\u2014it\u2019s too much work.</p> <p>The kishin oni Inma (self-absorbed female kishin oni demigod) has emerged from her solitude for the first time in centuries.

Yet while Inma doesn\u2019t fear any oni in Tian Xia, her pride prevents her from admitting she needs help. The self-styled Empress of the World\u2019s return has sent shock waves through oni society. Some believe she and Tsuneni plan to combine forces and conquer the rest of Tian Xia while others curry her favor, assuming she\u2019s looking to replace the shogun.

It came off the tombstone like a loosed arrow, all hollow eyes and exposed bone, and Da Baishan barely got his short sword up before its claws raked across his guard. The orc cursed in his mother tongue, pivoting on the soft graveyard earth, trying to track the thing as it circled him with the low, sideways prowl of a predator that had forgotten it no longer needed to eat. Behind him, the cricket sang on\u2014a thin, bright thread of sound cutting through the groans and the clash of steel. Somewhere to the north, Boone roared and something wet came apart. Nearby, Donkey's Daze spell washed over the shambling zombie and found nothing to grip\u2014no mind behind those hollow eyes, no thoughts to jolt. The old wizard's face flickered with surprise, then understanding. But here, in this corner of the cemetery between the family plots and the low stone markers, it was just Baishan and the cat and the strange cold feeling that had been crawling up his spine since they'd entered the graveyard.</p> <p>The cat lunged. Baishan saw the arc of its claws, knew the angle, knew he couldn't get the blade around in time\u2014and then the air between them thickened. A shape condensed out of nothing: blue-white, translucent, shimmering like heat haze off summer stone. It was a man. Or the memory of a man. He stood with his back to Baishan, arms spread as if to embrace the blow, and when the cat's claws struck they passed through him with a sound like tearing silk and found nothing beyond. The cat hissed\u2014a rattling, waterlogged sound\u2014and recoiled. Water dripped from the spirit's face, from the tattered sleeves of clothing that was not from Willowshore, and for a heartbeat Baishan was standing by the river again in the dark, watching this same figure die. Ginkgo, ten feet away, had gone completely still. The leshy's fungal eyes were wide, fixed on the apparition. No one else saw it. The spirit turned\u2014slowly, as if moving through deep water\u2014and looked at the orc who had hidden his body in the forest.</p> <p>Its mouth moved. The words arrived not through the air but somewhere behind the eyes, settling into understanding the way ink bleeds into wet paper: You carry me into earth that is not my own. My ties bind beyond these roots. Something stolen. Something broken. The spirit's gaze was not angry. It was tired. It was the look of someone standing at a door they cannot open, holding a key that fits no lock they can find. Then the cat snarled and gathered itself for another pounce, and Baishan blinked, and the spirit was gone\u2014dissolved into the autumn light like breath on a cold morning. From across the graveyard, a shuriken whistled through the air and buried itself in the cat's hollow eye socket with a sound like a nail driven into rotten wood. The creature collapsed. The cricket sang. And Da Baishan stood among the graves, holding a debt he did not yet know how to pay.</p>"},{"location":"sessions/2026-02-12/","title":"Session Three: Mystery at the Mourndusk Willow","text":"<p>Date: February 12, 2026</p>"},{"location":"sessions/2026-02-12/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>The party ventured into the Dark Woods to investigate the Mourndusk Willow\u2014the ancient tree Magistrate Kurosawa has been secretly visiting.

He placed both hands\u2014small, fungal, stained with his own body where he'd torn pieces away to make the salve\u2014flat against the animal's ribs. The fur was coarse and warm. Beneath it, nothing moved. The yellow lichen still clung to patches of the bear's hide, but it was graying now, losing its hold, flaking away like old paint in rain. Ginkgo closed his eyes. Through his palms, through the ground beneath his bare feet, through the vast and ancient web of mycelium that threaded the soil of every forest he had ever loved, he felt the bear's warmth begin its long migration downward\u2014out of muscle and bone and into the earth that had been waiting for it all along.</p> <p>\"The soil welcomes you,\" Ginkgo said. His voice was not loud. It did not need to be. \"By tomorrow the forest will know your name.\" He stayed there a moment longer, hands pressed to the still chest, feeling the last heat leave. Then he stood, wiped his palms on nothing\u2014leshies don't carry handkerchiefs\u2014and turned back to the wounded tree. There was still work to do.
